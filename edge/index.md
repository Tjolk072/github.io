> **The Docker CE Edge channel is deprecated in favor of nightly channel. See [About Docker CE](/install/index.md) for details on how to access the nightly channel.**

The latest Docker CE Stable release is **[{{ site.docker_ce_version }}](/engine/release-notes/)**.

Stable releases are not published to the Edge channel, so Linux repository users
should subscribe to the Stable channels.

> Commercial support is not available for Docker CE. For information about all Docker release channels and expectations about support, see [About Docker CE](/install/index.md).
