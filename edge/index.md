The current Docker CE Edge release is **[{{ site.docker_ce_edge_version }}](https://docs.docker.com/release-notes/docker-ce/#edge-releases)**.

The Docker CE Edge channel provides monthly releases which allow you to try new
features of Docker and verify bug fixes quickly. Each edge release is only
supported for one month and does not receive updates after a new Edge release is
available.

Stable releases are not published to the Edge channel, so Linux repository users
should subscribe to both Edge and Stable channels.

> Commercial support is not available for Docker CE. For information about all Docker release channels and expectations about support, see [Dockerchannels](/install/index.md#docker-channels).

Documentation for API and CLI references is updated with each Edge release as
appropriate. However, full documentation for features may not be available until
a Docker CE Stable release incorporates the feature.
