# Docker Marketing Site

## Requirements

You'll need to have the following items installed before continuing.

  * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org): Use the installer provided on the NodeJS website.
  * [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/): Run `sudo npm install -g grunt-cli`
  * [Bower](http://bower.io): Run `sudo npm install -g bower`

## Getting Started

From the docs-base directory, run:

    $ make build-theme

This will build everything in `src` and put it in `dist`.

## Directory Structure

* `dist`: Static pages are assembled here. This is where you should view the site in your browser. **Don't edit these files directly. They will be overwritten!**
* `src`: This is the directory you'll work in. 
* `src/assets`: All assets (scss, images, fonts, js, etc) go here.
* `src/assets/scss/_settings.scss`: Foundation configuration settings go in here.
* `src/assets/scss/app.scss`: Application styles go here.
