  On a manager node:

  ```bash
  $ docker service ls

  ID            NAME      MODE        REPLICAS    IMAGE
  c8wgl7q4ndfd  frontend  replicated  5/5         nginx:alpine
  dmu1ept4cxcf  redis     replicated  3/3         redis:3.0.6
  iwe3278osahj  mongo     global      7/7         mongo:3.3
  ```

  The `REPLICAS` column shows both the *actual* and *desired* number of tasks for
  the service.

  ### Filtering

  The filtering flag (`-f` or `--filter`) format is of "key=value". If there is more
  than one filter, then pass multiple flags (e.g., `--filter "foo=bar" --filter "bif=baz"`)

  The currently supported filters are:

  * [id](service_ls.md#id)
  * [label](service_ls.md#label)
  * [name](service_ls.md#name)

  #### id

  The `id` filter matches all or part of a service's id.

  ```bash
  $ docker service ls -f "id=0bcjw"
  ID            NAME   MODE        REPLICAS  IMAGE
  0bcjwfh8ychr  redis  replicated  1/1       redis:3.0.6
  ```

  #### label

  The `label` filter matches services based on the presence of a `label` alone or
  a `label` and a value.

  The following filter matches all services with a `project` label regardless of
  its value:

  ```bash
  $ docker service ls --filter label=project
  ID            NAME       MODE        REPLICAS  IMAGE
  01sl1rp6nj5u  frontend2  replicated  1/1       nginx:alpine
  36xvvwwauej0  frontend   replicated  5/5       nginx:alpine
  74nzcxxjv6fq  backend    replicated  3/3       redis:3.0.6
  ```

  The following filter matches only services with the `project` label with the
  `project-a` value.

  ```bash
  $ docker service ls --filter label=project=project-a
  ID            NAME      MODE        REPLICAS  IMAGE
  36xvvwwauej0  frontend  replicated  5/5       nginx:alpine
  74nzcxxjv6fq  backend   replicated  3/3       redis:3.0.6
  ```

  #### name

  The `name` filter matches on all or part of a service's name.

  The following filter matches services with a name containing `redis`.

  ```bash
  $ docker service ls --filter name=redis
  ID            NAME   MODE        REPLICAS  IMAGE
  0bcjwfh8ychr  redis  replicated  1/1       redis:3.0.6
  ```
