  ### Filtering

  The filtering flag (`-f` or `--filter`) format is a `key=value` pair. If there
  is more than one filter, then pass multiple flags (e.g. `--filter "foo=bar" --filter "bif=baz"`).
  Multiple filter flags are combined as an `OR` filter. For example,
  `-f name=redis.1 -f name=redis.7` returns both `redis.1` and `redis.7` tasks.

  The currently supported filters are:

  * id
  * name
  * desired-stat
