# Files and directories here are not edited in the docker.github.io repo.
# Instead, they are edited in the appropriate upstream repo and pulled
# into this repo periodically, or they are automatically generated. The intent
# is that if you submit a PR with changes to these files or directories, a CI
# job will fail in the PR, indicating that it should not be merged. THIS IS NOT
# YET IMPLEMENTED!! The PR reviewer should make sure no files here are in the PR.

# If you need to edit these files or directories, submit a PR in the repo and
# directory listed in "source" below.

# Make sure directories have the trailing slash, keep the list alphabetical
