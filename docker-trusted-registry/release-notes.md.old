# Docker Trusted Registry: Release Notes

## Prior Versions

These notes refer to the current release of Docker Trusted Registry and the commercially supported Docker Engine. For notes on older versions of these, see the [prior release notes archive](prior-release-notes.md).

## Docker Trusted Registry (DTR)

### DTR 1.1.0
(23 June 2015)

This release of DTR (formerly DHE) adds major integration with the AWS and Azure marketplaces, giving customers a smoother installation path. DTR 1.1 also adds finer-grained permissions and improvements and additions to the UI and logging. Bugs in LDAP/AD integration have also been remediated, improving the stability and usability of DTR. See below for specifics.

#### New Features

* New, more granular, [roles for users](/configuration.md#authentication). DTR users can now be assigned different levels of access (admin, r/w, r/o) to the repositories. **Important:** Existing DTR users should make sure to see the note [below](#upgrade-warning) regarding migrating users before upgrading.
* A new storage status indicator for storage space. The dashboard now shows used and available storage space for supported storage drivers.
* A new [diagnostics tool](/adminguide.md#Client-Docker-Daemon-diagnostics) gathers and bundles DTR logs, system information, container information, and other configuration settings for use by Docker support or as a backup.
* Performance and reliability improvements to the S3 storage backend.
* DTR images are now available on the Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure marketplaces.

#### Fixes

The following notable issues have been remediated:

* Fixed an issue that caused DTR logins to fail if some LDAP servers were unreachable.
* Fixed a resource leak in DTR storage.

### Upgrade Warning

Customers who are currently using DHE 1.0 **must** follow the [upgrading instructions](https://forums.docker.com/t/upgrading-docker-hub-enterprise-to-docker-trusted-registry/1925) in our support Knowledge Base. These instructions will show you how to modify existing authentication data and storage volume settings to move to DTR. Note that automatic upgrading has been disabled for DHE users because of these issues.

## Commercially Supported Docker Engine

### CS Docker Engine 1.6.2-cs5
(21 May 2015)

For customers running Docker Engine on [supported versions of RedHat Enterprise
Linux](https://www.docker.com/enterprise/support/) with [SELinux
enabled](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/
6/html/Security-Enhanced_Linux/sect-Security-Enhanced_Linux-Working_with_SELinux
-Enabling_and_Disabling_SELinux.html), the `docker build` and `docker run`
commands will not have DNS host name resolution and bind-mounted volumes may
not be accessible.
As a result, customers with SELinux will be unable to use hostname-based network
access in either `docker build` or `docker run`, nor will they be able to
`docker run` containers
that use `--volume` or `-v` bind-mounts (with an incorrect SELinux label) in
their environment. By installing Docker Engine 1.6.2-cs5, customers can use Docker as intended on RHEL with SELinux enabled.

For example, you see will failures like:

```
[root@dtr ~]# docker -v
Docker version 1.6.0-cs2, build b8dd430
[root@dtr ~]# ping dtr.home.org.au

```

or when running a `docker build`:

```
[root@dtr ~]# docker build .

One of the configured repositories failed (Fedora 21 - x86_64),
and yum doesn't have enough cached data to continue. At this point the only
safe thing yum can do is fail. There are a few ways to work "fix" this:

```

**Affected Versions**: All previous versions of Docker Engine when SELinux
is enabled.

Docker **highly recommends** that all customers running previous versions of
Docker Engine update to this release.

#### **How to workaround this issue**

Customers who choose not to install this update have two options. The
first option is to disable SELinux. This is *not recommended* for production
systems where SELinux is typically required.

The second option is to pass the following parameter in to `docker run`.

  	     --security-opt=label:type:docker_t

This parameter cannot be passed to the `docker build` command.

#### **Upgrade notes**

When upgrading, make sure you stop DTR first, perform the Engine upgrade, and
then restart DTR.

If you are running with SELinux enabled, previous Docker Engine releases allowed
you to bind-mount additional volumes or files inside the container as follows:

		$ docker run -it -v /home/user/foo.txt:/foobar.txt:ro <imagename>

In the 1.6.2-cs5 release, you must ensure additional bind-mounts have the correct
SELinux context. For example, if you want to mount `foobar.txt` as read-only
into the container, do the following to create and test your bind-mount:

1. Add the `z` option to the bind mount when you specify `docker run`.

		$ docker run -it -v /home/user/foo.txt:/foobar.txt:ro,z <imagename>

2. Exec into your new container.

	For example, if your container is `bashful_curie`, open a shell on the
	container:

		$ docker exec -it bashful_curie bash

3. Use `cat` to check the permissions on the mounted file.

		$ cat /foobar.txt
		the contents of foobar appear

	If you see the file's contents, your mount succeeded. If you receive a
	`Permission denied` message and/or the `/var/log/audit/audit.log` file on
	your Docker host contains an AVC Denial message, the mount did not succeed.

		type=AVC msg=audit(1432145409.197:7570): avc:  denied  { read } for  pid=21167 comm="cat" name="foobar.txt" dev="xvda2" ino=17704136 scontext=system_u:system_r:svirt_lxc_net_t:s0:c909,c965 tcontext=unconfined_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0 tclass=file

	Recheck your command line to make sure you passed in the `z` option.
