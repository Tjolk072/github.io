You can downgrade or cancel your private repository subscription plan through
Docker Hub. Every user account is entitled to one free private repository,
while an organization with no subscription plan can only have public
repositories.

## Prerequisites
Before cancelling your private repository subscription, either change your
private repositories to public, or delete them.

>**Warning:** Once you cancel a subscription plan, any private repositories
> become locked, disabling pushing and pulling.
