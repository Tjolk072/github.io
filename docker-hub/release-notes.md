# 2019-11-04

### Enhancements

* The [repositories page](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/) and all
related settings and tabs have been updated and moved from `cloud.docker.com`
to `hub.docker.com`. You can access the page at its new URL: [https://hub.docker.com/repositories](https://hub.docker.com/repositories). 

### Known Issues

* Scan results don't appear for some official images.

# 2019-10-21

### New features
* **Beta:** Docker Hub now supports [two-factor authentication (2FA)](/docker-hub/2fa). Enable it in your account settings, under the **[Security](https://hub.docker.com/settings/security)** section.

    > If you lose both your 2FA authentication device and recovery code, you may
    > not be able to recover your account.
    {: .important }

### Enhancements
* As a security measure, when two-factor authentication is enabled, the Docker CLI requires a personal access token instead of a password to log in.

### Known Issues

* Scan results don't appear for some official images.

Each organization page now breaks down into these tabs:
  * **New:** Members - manage your members directly from this page (delete,
  add, or open their teams)
  * **New:** Teams - search by team or username, and open up any team page to
  manage the team
  * **New:** Invitees (conditional tab, only if an invite exists) - resend or
  remove invitiations from this tab
  * Repositories
  * Settings
  * Billing
