<p><a href="index.md">Collections and grants</a> are strong tools that can be used to control
access and visibility to resources in UCP.</p>

<p>This tutorial describes a fictitious company named OrcaBank that needs to
configure an  architecture in UCP with role-based access control (RBAC) for
their application engineering group.</p>

<h2 id="team-access-requirements">Team access requirements</h2>

<p>OrcaBank reorganized their application teams by product with each team providing
shared services as necessary. Developers at OrcaBank do their own DevOps and
deploy and manage the lifecycle of their applications.</p>

<p>OrcaBank has four teams with the following resource needs:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">security</code> should have view-only access to all applications in the cluster.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">db</code> should have full access to all database applications and resources. See
<a href="#db-team">DB Team</a>.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">mobile</code> should have full access to their mobile applications and limited
access to shared <code class="highlighter-rouge">db</code> services. See <a href="#mobile-team">Mobile Team</a>.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">payments</code> should have full access to their payments applications and limited
access to shared <code class="highlighter-rouge">db</code> services.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="role-composition">Role composition</h2>

<p>To assign the proper access, OrcaBank is employing a combination of default
and custom roles:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">View Only</code> (default role) allows users to see all resources (but not edit or use).</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Ops</code> (custom role) allows users to perform all operations against configs,
containers, images, networks, nodes, secrets, services, and volumes.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">View &amp; Use Networks + Secrets</code> (custom role) enables users to view/connect to
networks and view/use secrets used by <code class="highlighter-rouge">db</code> containers, but prevents them from
seeing or impacting the <code class="highlighter-rouge">db</code> applications themselves.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="collection-architecture">Collection architecture</h2>

<p>OrcaBank is also creating collections of resources to mirror their team
structure.</p>

<p>Currently, all OrcaBank applications share the same physical resources, so all
nodes and applications are being configured in collections that nest under the
built-in collection, <code class="highlighter-rouge">/Shared</code>.</p>

<p>Other collections are also being created to enable shared <code class="highlighter-rouge">db</code> applications.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> For increased security with node-based isolation, use Docker
Enterprise Advanced.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">/Shared/mobile</code> hosts all Mobile applications and resources.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">/Shared/payments</code> hosts all Payments applications and resources.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">/Shared/db</code> is a top-level collection for all <code class="highlighter-rouge">db</code> resources.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">/Shared/db/payments</code> is a collection of <code class="highlighter-rouge">db</code> resources for Payments applications.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">/Shared/db/mobile</code> is a collection of <code class="highlighter-rouge">db</code> resources for Mobile applications.</li>
</ul>

<p>The collection architecture has the following tree representation:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>/
├── System
└── Shared
    ├── mobile
    ├── payments
    └── db
        ├── mobile
        └── payments
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>OrcaBank’s <a href="#grant-composition">Grant composition</a> ensures that their collection
architecture gives the <code class="highlighter-rouge">db</code> team access to <em>all</em> <code class="highlighter-rouge">db</code> resources and  restricts
app teams to <em>shared</em> <code class="highlighter-rouge">db</code> resources.</p>

<h2 id="ldapad-integration">LDAP/AD integration</h2>

<p>OrcaBank has standardized on LDAP for centralized authentication to help their
identity team scale across all the platforms they manage.</p>

<p>To implement LDAP authentication in UCP, OrcaBank is using UCP’s native LDAP/AD
integration to map LDAP groups directly to UCP teams. Users can be added to or
removed from UCP teams via LDAP which can be managed centrally by OrcaBank’s
identity team.</p>

<p>The following grant composition shows how LDAP groups are mapped to UCP teams.</p>

<h2 id="grant-composition">Grant composition</h2>

<p>OrcaBank is taking advantage of the flexibility in UCP’s grant model by applying
two grants to each application team. One grant allows each team to fully
manage the apps in their own collection, and the second grant gives them the
(limited) access they need to networks and secrets within the <code class="highlighter-rouge">db</code> collection.</p>

<h2 id="orcabank-access-architecture">OrcaBank access architecture</h2>

<p>OrcaBank’s resulting access architecture shows applications connecting across
collection boundaries. By assigning multiple grants per team, the Mobile and
Payments applications teams can connect to dedicated Database resources through
a secure and controlled interface, leveraging Database networks and secrets.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> In Docker Enterprise Standard, all resources are deployed across the
same  group of UCP worker nodes. Node segmentation is provided in Docker
Enterprise Advanced and discussed in the <a href="ee-advanced.md">next tutorial</a>.</p>

<h3 id="db-team">DB team</h3>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">db</code> team is responsible for deploying and managing the full lifecycle
of the databases used by the application teams. They can execute the full set of
operations against all database resources.</p>

<p><img src="../images/design-access-control-adv-3.png" alt="image" class="with-border" /></p>

<h3 id="mobile-team">Mobile team</h3>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">mobile</code> team is responsible for deploying their own application stack,
minus the database tier that is managed by the <code class="highlighter-rouge">db</code> team.</p>
