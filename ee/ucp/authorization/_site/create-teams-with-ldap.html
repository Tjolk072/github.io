<h2 id="binding-to-the-ldap-server">Binding to the LDAP server</h2>

<p>There are two methods for matching group members from an LDAP directory, direct
bind and search bind.</p>

<p>Select <strong>Immediately Sync Team Members</strong> to run an LDAP sync operation
immediately after saving the configuration for the team. It may take a moment
before the members of the team are fully synced.</p>

<h3 id="match-group-members-direct-bind">Match Group Members (Direct Bind)</h3>

<p>This option specifies that team members should be synced directly with members
of a group in your organization’s LDAP directory. The team’s membership will by
synced to match the membership of the group.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Group DN</strong>: The distinguished name of the group from which to select users.</li>
  <li><strong>Group Member Attribute</strong>: The value of this group attribute corresponds to
the distinguished names of the members of the group.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="match-search-results-search-bind">Match Search Results (Search Bind)</h3>

<p>This option specifies that team members should be synced using a search query
against your organization’s LDAP directory. The team’s membership will be
synced to match the users in the search results.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Search Base DN</strong>: Distinguished name of the node in the directory tree where
the search should start looking for users.</li>
  <li><strong>Search Filter</strong>: Filter to find users. If null, existing users in the search
scope are added as members of the team.</li>
  <li><strong>Search subtree</strong>: Defines search through the full LDAP tree, not just one
level, starting at the Base DN.</li>
</ul>
