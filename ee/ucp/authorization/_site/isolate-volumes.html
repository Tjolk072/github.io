<p>In this example, two teams are granted access to volumes in two different
resource collections. UCP access control prevents the teams from viewing and
accessing each other’s volumes, even though they may be located in the same
nodes.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create two teams.</li>
  <li>Create two collections, one for either team.</li>
  <li>Create grants to manage access to the collections.</li>
  <li>Team members create volumes that are specific to their team.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="create-two-teams">Create two teams</h2>

<p>Navigate to the <strong>Organizations &amp; Teams</strong> page to create two teams in the
“engineering” organization, named “Dev” and “Prod”. Add a user who’s not a UCP administrator to the Dev team, and add another non-admin user to the Prod team. <a href="create-users-and-teams-manually.md">Learn how to create and manage teams</a>.</p>

<h2 id="create-resource-collections">Create resource collections</h2>

<p>In this example, the Dev and Prod teams use two different volumes, which they
access through two corresponding resource collections. The collections are
placed under the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/Shared</code> collection.</p>

<ol>
  <li>In the left pane, click <strong>Collections</strong> to show all of the resource
collections in the swarm.</li>
  <li>Find the <strong>/Shared</strong> collection and click <strong>View children</strong>.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Create collection</strong> and name the new collection “dev-volumes”.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Create</strong> to create the collection.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Create collection</strong> again, name the new collection “prod-volumes”,
and click <strong>Create</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="create-grants-for-controlling-access-to-the-new-volumes">Create grants for controlling access to the new volumes</h2>

<p>In this example, the Dev team gets access to its volumes from a grant that
associates the team with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/Shared/dev-volumes</code> collection, and the Prod
team gets access to its volumes from another grant that associates the team
with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/Shared/prod-volumes</code> collection.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Navigate to the <strong>Grants</strong> page and click <strong>Create Grant</strong>.</li>
  <li>In the left pane, click <strong>Collections</strong>, and in the <strong>Swarm</strong> collection,
click <strong>View Children</strong>.</li>
  <li>In the <strong>Shared</strong> collection, click <strong>View Children</strong>.</li>
  <li>In the list, find <strong>/Shared/dev-volumes</strong> and click <strong>Select Collection</strong>.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Roles</strong>, and in the dropdown, select <strong>Restricted Control</strong>.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Subjects</strong>, and under <strong>Select subject type</strong>, click <strong>Organizations</strong>.
In the dropdown, pick the <strong>engineering</strong> organization, and in the
<strong>Team</strong> dropdown, select <strong>Dev</strong>.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Create</strong> to grant permissions to the Dev team.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Create Grant</strong> and repeat the previous steps for the <strong>/Shared/prod-volumes</strong>
collection and the Prod team.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="../images/isolate-volumes-1.png" alt="" class="with-border" /></p>

<p>With the collections and grants in place, users can sign in and create volumes
in their assigned collections.</p>

<h2 id="create-a-volume-as-a-team-member">Create a volume as a team member</h2>

<p>Team members have permission to create volumes in their assigned collection.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Log in as one of the users on the Dev team.</li>
  <li>Navigate to the <strong>Volumes</strong> page to view all of the volumes in the
swarm that the user can access.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Create volume</strong> and name the new volume “dev-data”.</li>
  <li>In the left pane, click <strong>Collections</strong>. The default collection
appears. At the top of the page, click <strong>Shared</strong>, find the <strong>dev-volumes</strong> collection in the list, and click <strong>Select Collection</strong>.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Create</strong> to add the “dev-data” volume to the collection.</li>
  <li>Log in as one of the users on the Prod team, and repeat the
previous steps to create a “prod-data” volume assigned to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/Shared/prod-volumes</code> collection.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="../images/isolate-volumes-2.png" alt="" class="with-border" /></p>

<p>Now you can see role-based access control in action for volumes. The user on
the Prod team can’t see the Dev team’s volumes, and if you log in again as a
user on the Dev team, you won’t see the Prod team’s volumes.</p>

<p><img src="../images/isolate-volumes-3.png" alt="" class="with-border" /></p>

<p>Sign in with a UCP administrator account, and you see all of the volumes
created by the Dev and Prod users.</p>
