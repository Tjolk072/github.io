## Cluster Ingress capabilities

Cluster Ingress provides L7 services to traffic entering a Docker Enterprise cluster for a variety of different use-cases that help provide application resilience, security, and observability. Ingress provides dynamic control of L7 routing in a highly available architecture that is also high performing.

UCP's Ingress for Kubernetes is based on the [Istio](https://istio.io/) control-plane and is a simplified deployment focused on just providing ingress services with minimal complexity. This includes features such as:

- L7 host and path routing
- Complex path matching and redirection rules
- Weight-based load balancing
- TLS termination
- Persistent L7 sessions
- Hot config reloads
- Redundant and highly available design

For a detailed look at Istio Ingress architecture, refer to the [Istio Ingress docs.](https://istio.io/docs/tasks/traffic-management/ingress/)

To get started with UCP Ingress, the following help topics are provided:

- [Install Cluster Ingress on a UCP Cluster](./install/)
- [Deploy a Sample Application with Ingress Rules](./ingress)
- [Deploy a Sample Application with a Canary Release](./canary/)
- [Deploy a Sample Application with Sticky Sessions](./sticky/)
