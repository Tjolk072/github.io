Pod Security Policies (PSPs) are cluster-level resources which are enabled by
default in Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP) 3.2. See [Pod Security
Policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/) for an
explanation of this Kubernetes concept.

There are two default PSPs in UCP: a `privileged` policy and an `unprivileged`
policy. Administrators of the cluster can enforce additional policies and apply
them to users and teams for further control of what runs in the Kubernetes
cluster. This guide describes the two default policies, and provides two
example use cases for custom policies.

## Kubernetes Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

To interact with PSPs, a user will need to be granted access to the
`PodSecurityPolicy` object in Kubernetes RBAC. If the user is a `UCP Admin`,
then the user can  already manipulate PSPs. A normal user can interact with
policies if a UCP admin creates the following `ClusterRole` and
`ClusterRoleBinding`: 

```
$ cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: psp-admin
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - extensions
  resources:
  - podsecuritypolicies
  verbs:
  - create
  - delete
  - get
  - list
  - patch
  - update
EOF

$ USER=jeff

$ cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: psp-admin:$USER
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: psp-admin
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: $USER
EOF
```

## Default pod security policies in UCP

By default, there are two policies defined within UCP, `privileged` and
`unprivileged`. Additionally, there is a `ClusterRoleBinding` that gives every
single user access to the privileged policy. This is for backward compatibility
after an upgrade. By default, any user can create any pod.

> Note: PSPs do not override security defaults built into the
> UCP RBAC engine for Kubernetes pods. These [Security
> defaults](https://docs.docker.com/ee/ucp/authorization/) prevent non-admin
> users from mounting host paths into pods or starting privileged pods.

```bash
$ kubectl get podsecuritypolicies
NAME           PRIV    CAPS   SELINUX    RUNASUSER   FSGROUP    SUPGROUP   READONLYROOTFS   VOLUMES
privileged     true    *      RunAsAny   RunAsAny    RunAsAny   RunAsAny   false            *
unprivileged   false          RunAsAny   RunAsAny    RunAsAny   RunAsAny   false            *
```

The specification for the `privileged` policy is as follows:

```
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: true
  allowedCapabilities:
  - '*'
  fsGroup:
    rule: RunAsAny
  hostIPC: true
  hostNetwork: true
  hostPID: true
  hostPorts:
  - max: 65535
    min: 0
  privileged: true
  runAsUser:
    rule: RunAsAny
  seLinux:
    rule: RunAsAny
  supplementalGroups:
    rule: RunAsAny
  volumes:
  - '*'
```

The specification for the `unprivileged` policy is as follows:

```
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  allowedHostPaths:
  - pathPrefix: /dev/null
    readOnly: true
  fsGroup:
    rule: RunAsAny
  hostPorts:
  - max: 65535
    min: 0
  runAsUser:
    rule: RunAsAny
  seLinux:
    rule: RunAsAny
  supplementalGroups:
    rule: RunAsAny
  volumes:
  - '*'
```

## Use the unprivileged policy

> Note: When following this guide, if the prompt `$` follows `admin`, the action
> needs to be performed by a user with access to create pod security policies as
> discussed in [the Kubernetes RBAC section](#kubernetes-role-based-access-control). If the prompt `$`
> follows `user`, the UCP account does not need access to the PSP
> object in Kubernetes. The user only needs the ability to create Kubernetes pods.
> 

To switch users from the `privileged` policy to the `unprivileged` policy (or
any custom policy), an admin must first remove the `ClusterRoleBinding` that
links all users and service accounts to the `privileged` policy.

```
admin $ kubectl delete clusterrolebindings ucp:all:privileged-psp-role
```

When the `ClusterRoleBinding` is removed, cluster admins can still deploy pods,
and these pods are deployed with the `privileged` policy. But users or service
accounts are unable to deploy pods, because Kubernetes does not know what pod
security policy to apply. Note cluster admins would not be able to deploy
deployments, see [using the unprivileged policy in a
deployment](#using-the-unprivileged-policy-in-a-deployment) for more details.

```bash
user $ kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
Error from server (Forbidden): error when creating "pod.yaml": pods "demopod" is forbidden: unable to validate against any pod security policy: []
```

Therefore, to allow a user or a service account to use the `unprivileged` policy
(or any custom policy), you must create a `RoleBinding` to link that user or
team with the alternative policy. For the `unprivileged` policy, a `ClusterRole`
has already been defined, but has not been attached to a user. 

```bash
# List Existing Cluster Roles
admin $ kubectl get clusterrole | grep psp
privileged-psp-role                                                    3h47m
unprivileged-psp-role                                                  3h47m

# Define which user to apply the ClusterRole too
admin $ USER=jeff

# Create a RoleBinding linking the ClusterRole to the User 
admin $ cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: unprivileged-psp-role:$USER
  namespace: default
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: unprivileged-psp-role
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: $USER
  namespace: default
EOF
```

In the following example, when user "jeff" deploys a basic `nginx` pod, the `unprivileged` policy 
then gets applied.

```bash
user $ cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: demopod
spec:
  containers:
    - name:  demopod
      image: nginx
EOF

user $ kubectl get pods
NAME      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
demopod   1/1     Running   0          10m
```

To check which PSP is applied to a pod, you can get a detailed
view of the pod spec using the `-o yaml` or `-o json` syntax with `kubectl`. You
can parse JSON output with [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/). 

```bash
user $ kubectl get pods demopod -o json | jq -r '.metadata.annotations."kubernetes.io/psp"'
unprivileged
```

### Using the unprivileged policy in a deployment

> Note: In a most use cases a Pod is not actually scheduled by a user. When
> creating Kubernetes objects such as Deployments or Daemonsets the pods are
> being scheduled by a service account or a controller.

If you have disabled the `privileged` PSP policy, and created a `RoleBinding`
to map a user to a new PSP policy, Kubernetes objects like Deployments and
Daemonsets will not be able to deploy pods. This is because Kubernetes objects,
like Deployments, use a `Service Account` to schedule pods, instead of the user
that created the Deployment. 

```bash
user $ kubectl get deployments
NAME    READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx   0/1     0            0           88s

user $ kubectl get replicasets
NAME              DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
nginx-cdcdd9f5c   1         0         0       92s

user $ kubectl describe replicasets nginx-cdcdd9f5c
...
  Warning  FailedCreate  48s (x15 over 2m10s)  replicaset-controller  Error creating: pods "nginx-cdcdd9f5c-" is forbidden: unable to validate against any pod security policy: []
```

For this deployment to be able to schedule pods, the service account defined
wthin the deployment specification needs to be associated with a PSP policy.
If a service account is not defined within a deployment spec, the default
service account in a namespace is used.

This is the case in the deployment output above, there is no service account
defined, therefore a `Rolebinding` to grant the default service account in the
default namespace to use PSP policy is needed. 

An example `RoleBinding` to associate the `unprivileged` PSP policy in UCP with
the defaut service account in the default namespace is:

```bash
admin $ cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: unprivileged-psp-role:defaultsa
  namespace: default
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: unprivileged-psp-role
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: default
  namespace: default
EOF
```

This should allow the replica set to schedule pods within the cluster:

```bash
user $ kubectl get deployments
NAME    READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx   1/1     1            1           6m11s

user $ kubectl get replicasets
NAME              DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
nginx-cdcdd9f5c   1         1         1       6m16s

user $ kubectl get pods
NAME                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-cdcdd9f5c-9kknc   1/1     Running   0          6m17s

user $ kubectl get pod nginx-cdcdd9f5c-9kknc  -o json | jq -r '.metadata.annotations."kubernetes.io/psp"'
unprivileged
```

### Applying the unprivileged PSP policy to a namespace

A common use case when using PSPs is to apply a particular policy to one
namespace, but not configure the rest. An example could be where an admin
might be want to configure keep the `privileged` policy for all of the
infrastructure namespaces but configure the `unprivileged` policy for the
end user namespaces. This can be done with the following example:

In this demonstration cluster, infrastructure workloads are deployed in the
`kube-system` and the `monitoring` namespaces. End User workloads are deployed
in the `default` namespace.

```bash
admin $ kubectl get namespaces
NAME              STATUS   AGE
default           Active   3d
kube-node-lease   Active   3d
kube-public       Active   3d
kube-system       Active   3d
monitoring        Active   3d
```

First, delete the `ClusterRoleBinding` that is applied by default in UCP.

```bash
admin $ kubectl delete clusterrolebindings ucp:all:privileged-psp-role
```

Next, create a new `ClusterRoleBinding` that will enforce the `privileged` PSP
policy for all users and service accounts in the `kube-system` and `monitoring`
namespaces, where in this example cluster the infrastructure workloads are
deployed. 

```bash
admin $ cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: ucp:infrastructure:privileged-psp-role
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: privileged-psp-role
subjects:
- kind: Group
  name: system:authenticated:kube-system
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
- kind: Group
  name: system:authenticated:monitoring
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
- kind: Group
  name: system:serviceaccounts:kube-system
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
- kind: Group
  name: system:serviceaccounts:monitoring
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
EOF
```

Finally, create a `ClusterRoleBinding` to allow all users who deploy pods and
deployments in the `default` namespace to use the `unprivileged` policy. 

```bash
admin $ cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: ucp:default:unprivileged-psp-role
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: unprivileged-psp-role
subjects:
- kind: Group
  name: system:authenticated:default
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
- kind: Group
  name: system:serviceaccounts:default
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
EOF
```

Now when the user deploys in the `default` namespace they will get the
`unprivileged` policy but when they deploy in the monitoring namespace they
will get the `privileged` policy.

```bash
user $ cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: demopod
  namespace: monitoring
spec:
  containers:
    - name:  demopod
      image: nginx
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: demopod
  namespace: default
spec:
  containers:
    - name:  demopod
      image: nginx
EOF
```

```bash
user $ kubectl get pods demopod -n monitoring -o json | jq -r '.metadata.annotations."kubernetes.io/psp"'
privileged

user $ kubectl get pods demopod -n default -o json | jq -r '.metadata.annotations."kubernetes.io/psp"'
unprivileged
```

## Reenable the privileged PSP for all users

To revert to the default UCP configuration, in which all UCP users and service
accounts use the `privileged` PSP, recreate the default
`ClusterRoleBinding`:

```bash
admin $ cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: ucp:all:privileged-psp-role
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: privileged-psp-role
subjects:
- kind: Group
  name: system:authenticated
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
- kind: Group
  name: system:serviceaccounts
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
EOF
```

## PSP examples

UCP admins or users with the [correct
permissions](#kubernetes-role-based-access-control) can create their own custom
policies and attach them to UCP users or teams. This section highlights two
potential use cases for custom PSPs. These two uses cases can be combined into
the same policy. Note there are many more use cases with PSPs not covered in
this document.

- Preventing containers that start as the Root User

- Applying default seccomp policies to all Kubernetes Pods.

For the full list of parameters that can be configured in a PSP,
see the [Kubernetes
documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/).

### Example 1: Use a PSP to enforce "no root users"

A common use case for PSPs is to prevent a user from deploying
containers that run with the root user. A PSP can be created to
enforce this with the parameter `MustRunAsNonRoot`.

```bash
admin $ cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: PodSecurityPolicy
metadata:  
  name: norootcontainers
spec:
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  allowedHostPaths:
  - pathPrefix: /dev/null
    readOnly: true
  fsGroup:
    rule: RunAsAny
  hostPorts:
  - max: 65535
    min: 0
  runAsUser:
    rule: MustRunAsNonRoot
  seLinux:
    rule: RunAsAny
  supplementalGroups:
    rule: RunAsAny
  volumes:
  - '*'
EOF
```

If not done previously, the admin user must remove the `ClusterRoleBinding`
for the `privileged` policy, and then add a new `ClusterRole` and `RoleBinding`
to link a user to the new `norootcontainers` policy.

```bash
# Delete the default privileged ClusterRoleBinding
admin $ kubectl delete clusterrolebindings ucp:all:privileged-psp-role

# Create a ClusterRole Granting Access to the Policy
admin $ cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: norootcontainers-psp-role
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - policy
  resourceNames:
  - norootcontainers
  resources:
  - podsecuritypolicies
  verbs:
  - use
EOF

# Define a User to attach to the No Root Policy
admin $ USER=jeff

# Create a RoleBinding attaching the User to the ClusterRole
admin $ cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: norootcontainers-psp-role:$USER
  namespace: default
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: norootcontainers-psp-role
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: $USER
  namespace: default
EOF
```

If a user tries to deploy a pod that runs as a root user, such as the upstream
`nginx` image, this should fail with a `ConfigError`.

```bash
user $ cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: demopod
spec:
  containers:
    - name:  demopod
      image: nginx
EOF

user $ kubectl get pods
NAME      READY   STATUS                       RESTARTS   AGE
demopod   0/1     CreateContainerConfigError   0          37s

user $ kubectl describe pods demopod
<..>
 Error: container has runAsNonRoot and image will run as root
```

### Example 2: Use a PSP to apply seccomp policies

A second use case for PSPs is to prevent a user from deploying
containers without a [seccomp
policy](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/seccomp/). By default,
Kubernetes does not apply a seccomp policy to pods, so a default seccomp policy
could be applied for all pods by a PSP.

```bash
admin $ cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: PodSecurityPolicy
metadata:  
  name: seccomppolicy
  annotations:
    seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/allowedProfileNames: 'docker/default'
    seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/defaultProfileName:  'docker/default'
spec:
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  allowedHostPaths:
  - pathPrefix: /dev/null
    readOnly: true
  fsGroup:
    rule: RunAsAny
  hostPorts:
  - max: 65535
    min: 0
  runAsUser:
    rule: RunAsAny
  seLinux:
    rule: RunAsAny
  supplementalGroups:
    rule: RunAsAny
  volumes:
  - '*'
EOF
```

If not done previously, the admin user must remove the `ClusterRoleBinding`
for the `privileged` policy, and then add a new `ClusterRole` and `RoleBinding`
to link a user to the new `applyseccompprofile` policy.

```bash
# Delete the default privileged ClusterRoleBinding
admin $ kubectl delete clusterrolebindings ucp:all:privileged-psp-role

# Create a ClusterRole Granting Access to the Policy
admin $ cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: applyseccompprofile-psp-role
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - policy
  resourceNames:
  - seccomppolicy
  resources:
  - podsecuritypolicies
  verbs:
  - use
EOF

# Define a User to attach to the No Root Policy
admin $ USER=jeff

# Create a RoleBinding attaching the User to the ClusterRole
admin $ cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: applyseccompprofile-psp-role:$USER
  namespace: default
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: applyseccompprofile-psp-role
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: $USER
  namespace: default
EOF
```

As shown in the following example, if a user tries to deploy an `nginx` pod without applying 
a seccomp policy as the pod metadata, Kubernetes automatically applies a policy for the user. 

```bash
user $ cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: demopod
spec:
  containers:
    - name:  demopod
      image: nginx
EOF

user $ kubectl get pods
NAME      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
demopod   1/1     Running   0          16s

user $ kubectl get pods demopod -o json | jq '.metadata.annotations."seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/pod"'
"docker/default"
```
