Docker Universal Control Plane deploys images for a number of different
hardware architectures. Some architectures require
pulling images with specific tags or names indicating the target
architecture.

## OS-specific component names

Some UCP component names depend on the node's operating system. Use the
following table to ensure that you're pulling the right images for each node.

| UCP component base name | Windows name   | 
|-------------------------|----------------|
| ucp-agent               | ucp-agent-win  | 
| ucp-dsinfo              | ucp-dsinfo-win |
