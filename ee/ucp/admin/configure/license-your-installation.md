After installing Docker Universal Control Plane, you need to license your
installation. Here's how to do it.

## Download your license

Go to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/editions/enterprise/docker-ee-trial/trial)
to get a free trial license.

## License your installation

Once you've downloaded the license file, you can apply it to your UCP
installation.

In the UCP web UI, log in with administrator credentials and
navigate to the **Admin Settings** page.

In the left pane, click **License** and click **Upload License**. The
license refreshes immediately, and you don't need to click **Save**.
