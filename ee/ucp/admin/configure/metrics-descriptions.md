# UCP metrics

The following table lists the metrics that UCP exposes in Prometheus, along with descriptions. Note that only the metrics 
labeled with `ucp_` are documented. Other metrics are exposed in Prometheus but are not documented.

## Metrics labels

Metrics exposed by UCP in Prometheus have standardized labels, depending on the resource that they are measuring. 
The following table lists some of the labels that are used, along with their values:

### Container labels

| Label name         | Value                                                                                       |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `collection`       | The collection ID of the collection this container is in, if any                            |
| `container`        | The ID of this container                                                                    |
| `image`            | The name of this container's image                                                          |
| `manager`          | "true" if the container's node is a UCP manager, "false" otherwise                          |
| `name`             | The name of the container                                                                   |
| `podName`          | If this container is part of a Kubernetes pod, this is the pod's name                       |
| `podNamespace`     | If this container is part of a Kubernetes pod, this is the pod's namespace                  |
| `podContainerName` | If this container is part of a Kubernetes pod, this is the container's name in the pod spec |
| `service`          | If this container is part of a Swarm service, this is the service ID                        |
| `stack`            | If this container is part of a Docker compose stack, this is the name of the stack          |

### Container networking labels

The following metrics measure network activity for a given network attached to a given
container. They have the same labels as Container labels, with one addition:

| Label name | Value                 |
|------------|-----------------------|
| `network`  | The ID of the network |

### Node labels

| Label name | Value                                                  |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `manager`    | "true" if the node is a UCP manager, "false" otherwise |

## Metric source

UCP exports metrics on every node and also exports additional metrics from
every controller. The metrics that are exported from controllers are
cluster-scoped, for example, the total number of Swarm services. Metrics that
are exported from nodes are specific to those nodes, for example, the total memory
on that node.
