You can publish a service and configure the proxy for persistent (sticky) sessions using:

- Cookies
- IP hashing

## Cookies
To configure sticky sessions using cookies:

1. Create an overlay network so that service traffic is isolated and secure, as shown in the following example:
```bash
$> docker network create -d overlay demo
1se1glh749q1i4pw0kf26mfx5
```
2. Create a service with the cookie to use for sticky sessions:
```bash
$> docker service create \
    --name demo \
    --network demo \
    --detach=false \
    --replicas=5 \
    --label com.docker.lb.hosts=demo.local \
    --label com.docker.lb.sticky_session_cookie=session \
    --label com.docker.lb.port=8080 \
    --env METADATA="demo-sticky" \
    ehazlett/docker-demo
```

Interlock detects when the service is available and publishes it. When tasks are running
and the proxy service is updated, the application is available via `http://demo.local`
and is configured to use sticky sessions:

```bash
$> curl -vs -c cookie.txt -b cookie.txt -H "Host: demo.local" http://127.0.0.1/ping
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) port 80 (#0)
> GET /ping HTTP/1.1
> Host: demo.local
> User-Agent: curl/7.54.0
> Accept: */*
> Cookie: session=1510171444496686286
>
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Server: nginx/1.13.6
< Date: Wed, 08 Nov 2017 20:04:36 GMT
< Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
< Content-Length: 117
< Connection: keep-alive
* Replaced cookie session="1510171444496686286" for domain demo.local, path /, expire 0
< Set-Cookie: session=1510171444496686286
< x-request-id: 3014728b429320f786728401a83246b8
< x-proxy-id: eae36bf0a3dc
< x-server-info: interlock/2.0.0-development (147ff2b1) linux/amd64
< x-upstream-addr: 10.0.2.5:8080
< x-upstream-response-time: 1510171476.948
<
{"instance":"9c67a943ffce","version":"0.1","metadata":"demo-sticky","request_id":"3014728b429320f786728401a83246b8"}
```

Notice the `Set-Cookie` from the application. This is stored by the `curl` command and is sent with subsequent requests,
which are pinned to the same instance. If you make a few requests, you will notice the same `x-upstream-addr`.

## IP Hashing
The following example shows how to configure sticky sessions using client IP hashing. This is not as flexible or consistent
as cookies but enables workarounds for some applications that cannot use the other method. When using IP hashing, reconfigure Interlock proxy to use [host mode networking](../config/host-mode-networking.md), because the default `ingress` networking mode uses SNAT, which obscures client IP addresses.

1. Create an overlay network so that service traffic is isolated and secure:
```bash
$> docker network create -d overlay demo
1se1glh749q1i4pw0kf26mfx5
```
2. Create a service with the cookie to use for sticky sessions using IP hashing:
```bash
$> docker service create \
    --name demo \
    --network demo \
    --detach=false \
    --replicas=5 \
    --label com.docker.lb.hosts=demo.local \
    --label com.docker.lb.port=8080 \
    --label com.docker.lb.ip_hash=true \
    --env METADATA="demo-sticky" \
    ehazlett/docker-demo
```

Interlock detects when the service is available and publishes it. When tasks are running
and the proxy service is updated, the application is available via `http://demo.local`
and is configured to use sticky sessions:

```bash
$> curl -vs -H "Host: demo.local" http://127.0.0.1/ping
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) port 80 (#0)
> GET /ping HTTP/1.1
> Host: demo.local
> User-Agent: curl/7.54.0
> Accept: */*
>
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Server: nginx/1.13.6
< Date: Wed, 08 Nov 2017 20:04:36 GMT
< Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
< Content-Length: 117
< Connection: keep-alive
< x-request-id: 3014728b429320f786728401a83246b8
< x-proxy-id: eae36bf0a3dc
< x-server-info: interlock/2.0.0-development (147ff2b1) linux/amd64
< x-upstream-addr: 10.0.2.5:8080

```

You can use `docker service scale demo=10` to add more replicas. When scaled, requests are pinned
to a specific backend.

> Note
> 
> Due to the way the IP hashing works for extensions, you will notice a new upstream address when scaling replicas.  This is
> expected, because internally the proxy uses the new set of replicas to determine a backend on which to pin. When the upstreams are
> determined, a new "sticky" backend is chosen as the dedicated upstream.
