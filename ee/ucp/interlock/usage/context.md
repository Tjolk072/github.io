The following example publishes a service using context or path based routing.

First, create an overlay network so that service traffic is isolated and secure:

```bash
$> docker network create -d overlay demo
1se1glh749q1i4pw0kf26mfx5
```

Next, create the initial service:

```bash
$> docker service create \
    --name demo \
    --network demo \
    --detach=false \
    --label com.docker.lb.hosts=demo.local \
    --label com.docker.lb.port=8080 \
    --label com.docker.lb.context_root=/app \
    --label com.docker.lb.context_root_rewrite=true \
    --env METADATA="demo-context-root" \
    ehazlett/docker-demo
```

> Only one path per host
>
> Interlock only supports one path per host per service cluster. When a
> specific `com.docker.lb.hosts` label is applied, it cannot be applied
> again in the same service cluster.
{: .important}

Interlock detects when the service is available and publishes it. After tasks are running
and the proxy service is updated, the application is available via `http://demo.local`:

```bash
$> curl -vs -H "Host: demo.local" http://127.0.0.1/app/
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) port 80 (#0)
> GET /app/ HTTP/1.1
> Host: demo.local
> User-Agent: curl/7.54.0
> Accept: */*
