DTR scans your images for vulnerabilities but sometimes it can report that
your image has vulnerabilities you know have been fixed. If that happens you
can dismiss the warning.

In the **DTR web UI**, navigate to the repository that has been scanned.

![Tag list](../../images/override-vulnerability-1.png){: .with-border}

Click **View details** for the image you want to see the scan results, and
and choose **Components** to see the vulnerabilities for each component packaged
in the image.

Select the component with the vulnerability you want to ignore, navigate to the
vulnerability, and click **hide**.

![Vulnerability list](../../images/override-vulnerability-2.png){: .with-border}

The vulnerability is hidden for the particular image and component. If this
vulnerability shows up in other images, it is still reported.

After dismissing a vulnerability, DTR won't re-evaluate the promotion policies
you have set up for the repository.
If you want the promotion policy to be re-evaluated for the image after hiding
a particular vulnerability, click **Promote**.
