You can configure the Docker Trusted Registry (DTR) to automatically delete unused image
layers, thus saving you disk space. This process is also known as garbage collection.

## How DTR deletes unused layers

First you configure DTR to run a garbage collection job on a fixed schedule. At
the scheduled time, DTR:

1. Identifies and marks unused image layers.
2. Deletes the marked image layers.

As of v2.6, DTR uses online garbage collection. This allows DTR to run garbage
collection without setting DTR to read-only/offline mode. In previous versions,
garbage collection would set DTR to read-only/offline mode so DTR would reject
pushes. Online garbage collection was an experimental feature in v2.5.

## Schedule garbage collection

In your browser, navigate to `https://<dtr-url>` and log in with your credentials. Select **System** on the left navigation pane, and then click
the **Garbage collection** tab to schedule garbage collection.

Select for how long the garbage collection job should run:
* Until done: Run the job until all unused image layers are deleted.
* For x minutes: Only run the garbage collection job for a maximum of x minutes
at a time.
* Never: Never delete unused image layers.

If you select ***Until done*** or ***For x minutes***, you can specify a recurring schedule in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) with the following options:
* Custom cron schedule - (Hour, Day of Month, Month, Weekday)
* Daily at midnight UTC
* Every Saturday at 1am UTC
* Every Sunday at 1am UTC
* Do not repeat

Once everything is configured you can choose to **Save & Start** to
run the garbage collection job immediately, or just **Save** to run the job on the next
scheduled interval.

## Review the garbage collection job log

In v2.5, you were notified with a banner under main navigation that no one can push images while a garbage collection job is running. With v2.6, this is no longer the case since garbage collection now happens while DTR is online and writable.

If you clicked **Save & Start** previously, verify that the garbage collection routine started by navigating to **Job Logs**.

## Under the hood

Each image stored in DTR is made up of multiple files:

* A list of image layers that are unioned which represents the image filesystem
* A configuration file that contains the architecture of the image and other
metadata
* A manifest file containing the list of all layers and configuration file for
an image

All these files are tracked in DTR's metadata store in RethinkDB. These files
are tracked in a content-addressable way such that a file corresponds to
a cryptographic hash of the file's content. This means that if two image tags hold exactly the same content, 
DTR only stores the image content once while making hash collisions nearly impossible,
even if the tag name is different.

As an example, if `wordpress:4.8` and `wordpress:latest` have the same content,
the content will only be stored once. If you delete one of these tags, the other won't
be deleted.

This means that when you delete an image tag, DTR cannot delete the underlying
files of that image tag since other tags may also use the same files.

To facilitate online garbage collection, DTR makes a couple of changes to how it uses the storage 
backend:
1. Layer links &ndash; the references within repository directories to 
their associated blobs &ndash; are no longer in the storage backend. That is because DTR stores these references in RethinkDB instead to enumerate through 
them during the marking phase of garbage collection. 

2. Any layers created after an upgrade to 2.6 are no longer content-addressed in 
the storage backend. Many cloud provider backends do not give the sequential 
consistency guarantees required to deal with the simultaneous deleting and 
re-pushing of a layer in a predictable manner. To account for this, DTR assigns 
each newly pushed layer a unique ID and performs the translation from content hash 
to ID in RethinkDB.

To delete unused files, DTR does the following:
1. Establish a cutoff time
2. Mark each referenced manifest file with a timestamp. When manifest files
are pushed to DTR, they are also marked with a timestamp
3. Sweep each manifest file that does not have a timestamp after the cutoff time
4. If a file is never referenced &ndash; which means no image tag uses it &ndash; delete the file
5. Repeat the process for blob links and blob descriptors.
