You should only restore Docker Enterprise Edition from a backup as a last resort. If you're running Docker
Enterprise Edition in high-availability mode, you can remove unhealthy nodes from the
swarm and join new ones to bring the swarm to an healthy state.

Restore components individually and in the following order:

1. [Restore Docker Swarm](restore-swarm).
2. [Restore Universal Control Plane (UCP)](restore-ucp).
3. [Restore Docker Trusted Registry (DTR)](restore-dtr).

## Where to go next
