- [Application Designer 0.1.4](/ee/desktop/app-designer/)

### Known issue

When you sign out of Windows while Docker Desktop is still running, and then sign in and start Docker Desktop, attempts to run Docker commands that rely on network connections can fail. For example, the command `docker pull alpine` returns `Error response from daemon: Get https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/: net/http: request canceled while waiting for connection (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)`.

Note that this issue occurs only when you sign out of Windows and not when you shut down or restart Windows.

Workaround: After signing back into Windows, when Docker Desktop has started, right-click the Docker menu from the systray and then select Quit Docker Desktop. When this is complete, start Docker Desktop normally.

## Version 2.0.0.6
2019-06-06

### Upgrades

- [Docker 19.03.0-rc2](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/) in Version Pack Enterprise 3.0
- Application Designer 0.1.3

### Bug fixes and minor changes

- Application Designer/ Docker Template CLI: The `DefaultServer` preference has been renamed to `DefaultRegistry`.
- Windows: Docker Desktop now allows administrators to specify authorized named pipes that can be mounted on Windows containers.
- Windows: Docker Desktop checks for stored credentials at startup before attempting to mount any shared drives. This prompts users to reenter the credentials if they are invalid.
- Mac: Docker Deskop does not send DNS queries for `docker-desktop.<domain>` every 10s. It relies on the host's DNS domain search order rather than trying to replicate it inside the VM.
- Mac: Docker Desktop now uses a separate thread to move its storage to a different disk. This allows the UI to remain responsive during the disk move. Fixes [docker/for-mac#3592](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3592)

## Version 2.0.0.5
2019-05-30

### Upgrades

- [Docker 19.03.0-rc1](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/) in Enterprise 3.0 version pack
- Application Designer 0.1.2
- [Qemu 4.0.0](https://github.com/docker/binfmt) to cross-compile ARM devices

### Bug fixes and minor changes

- Application Designer now allows users to copy and paste application logs.
- Users can browse the scaffold logs when scaffolding a new application using the Application Designer.
- Application Designer allows users to set preferences, including the default organization and registry.
- Docker Desktop admins can enforce Application Designer preferences using the `admin-settings.json` file.
- Security improvements: Docker Desktop now checks TLS certificates for the target endpoints when using `kubectl`.
- Fixed an issue where Visual Studio Code IDE path was not detected properly.

## Version 2.0.0.4
2019-05-16

### Upgrades

- [Docker 19.03.0-beta4](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/) in Enterprise 3.0 version pack
- [Docker 18.09.6](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/), [Kubernetes 1.11.10](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG-1.11.md#v11110) in Enterprise 2.1 version pack
- [LinuxKit v0.7](https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit/releases/tag/v0.7)

### Bug fixes and minor changes

- Fixed a stability issue with the DNS resolver.
- Fixed a race condition where Kubernetes sometimes failed to start after restarting the application.
- Fixed a bug that causes Docker Compose to fail when a user logs out after logging in. See [docker/compose#6517](https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/6517)
- Improved the reliability of `com.docker.osxfs trace` performance profiling command.
- Docker Desktop now supports large lists of resource DNS records on Mac. See [docker/for-mac#2160](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/2160#issuecomment-431571031).
- Users can now run a Docker registry in a container. See [docker/for-mac#3611](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3611).
- For Linux containers on Windows (LCOW), one physical computer system running Windows 10 Professional or Windows 10 Enterprise version 1809 or later is required.
- Added a dialog box during startup when a shared drive fails to mount. This allows users to retry mounting the drive or remove it from the shared drive list.

## Version 2.0.0.0
2019-01-31

### New features

- **Version selection**: Configurable version packs ensure the local
    instance of Docker Desktop Enterprise is a precise copy of the
    production environment where applications are deployed, and
    developers can switch between versions of Docker and
    Kubernetes with a single click.

- **Application Designer**: Application templates allow you to choose a
    technology and focus on business logic. Updates can be made with
    minimal syntax knowledge.

- **Device management**: The Docker Desktop Enterprise installer is available as standard MSI (Win) and PKG (Mac) downloads, which allows administrators to script an installation across many developer machines.

- **Administrative control**: IT organizations can specify and lock configuration parameters for creation of a standardized development environment, including disabling drive sharing and limiting version pack installations. Developers run commands in the command line without worrying about configuration settings.
