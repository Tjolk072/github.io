Docker Enterprise Edition (*Docker EE*) is designed for enterprise
development and IT teams who build, ship, and run business-critical
applications in production and at scale. Docker EE is integrated, certified,
and supported to provide enterprises with the most secure container platform
in the industry. For more info about Docker EE, including purchasing
options, see [Docker Enterprise Edition](https://www.docker.com/enterprise-edition/).

There are currently two versions of Docker EE Engine available:

* 18.03 - Use this version if you're only running Docker EE Engine.
* 17.06 - Use this version if you're using Docker Enterprise Edition 2.0 (Docker
Engine, UCP, and DTR).

## Docker EE tiers

{% include docker_ce_ee.md %}

### Enterprise Edition Basic

With Docker EE Basic, you can deploy Docker Enterprise Engine
to manage your container workloads in a flexible way. You can manage workloads
on Windows, Linux, on-premise or on the cloud.

Docker EE Basic has enterprise class support with defined SLAs, extended
maintenance cycles for patches for up to 24 months.

[Learn more about the supported platforms](#supported-platforms).

### Enterprise Edition Standard and Advanced

Docker EE Standard has everything the Basic edition has, and extends it with
private image management, integrated image signing policies, and cluster
management with support for Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrators.

Docker EE Advanced takes this one step further and allows you to implement
node-based RBAC policies, image promotion policies, image mirroring, and
scan your images for vulnerabilities.

## Supported platforms

The following table shows all of the platforms that are available for Docker EE.
Each link in the first column takes you to the installation
instructions for the corresponding platform. Docker EE is an integrated,
supported, and certified container platform for the listed cloud providers and
operating systems.


### On-premises

These are the operating systems where you can install Docker EE.

### Docker Certified Infrastructure

Docker Certified Infrastructure is Dockerâ€™s prescriptive approach to deploying
Docker Enterprise Edition (EE) on a range of infrastructure choices. Each Docker
Certified Infrastructure includes a reference architecture, automation templates,
and third-party ecosystem solution briefs.

## Docker Enterprise Edition release cycles

Each Docker EE release is supported and maintained for 24 months, and
receives security and critical bug fixes during this period.

The Docker API version is independent of the Docker platform version. We maintain
careful API backward compatibility and deprecate APIs and features slowly and
conservatively. We remove features after deprecating them for a period of
three stable releases. Docker 1.13 introduced improved interoperability
between clients and servers using different API versions, including dynamic
feature negotiation.

## Upgrades and support

If you're a Docker DDC or CS Engine customer, you don't need to upgrade to
Docker EE to continue to get support. We will continue to support customers
with valid subscriptions whether the subscription covers Docker EE or
Commercially Supported Docker. You can choose to stay with your current
deployed version, or you can upgrade to the latest Docker EE version. For
more info, see [Scope of Coverage and Maintenance
Lifecycle](https://success.docker.com/Policies/Scope_of_Support).
