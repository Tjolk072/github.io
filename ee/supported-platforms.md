Docker Enterprise is designed for enterprise development as well as IT teams who
build, ship, and run business-critical applications 
in production and at scale. Docker Enterprise is integrated, certified,
and supported to provide enterprises with the most secure container platform
in the industry. For more info about Docker Enterprise, including purchasing
options, see [Docker Enterprise](https://www.docker.com/enterprise-edition/).

## Docker Enterprise tiers

{% include docker_ce_ee.md %}

> Note
>
> Starting with Docker Enterprise 2.1, Docker Enterprise --- Basic, Docker Enterprise --- Standard,
> and Docker Enterprise --- Advanced are all now called Docker Enterprise.

### Docker Enterprise

With Docker Enterprise, you can deploy Docker Engine --- Enterprise
to manage your container workloads in a flexible way. You can manage workloads
on Windows, Linux, on site, or on the cloud.

Docker Enterprise has private image management, integrated image signing policies, and cluster
management with support for Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrators. It allows you to implement
node-based RBAC policies, image promotion policies, image mirroring, and
scan your images for vulnerabilities. It also has support with defined SLAs and extended
maintenance cycles for patches for up to 24 months.

### New Licensing for Docker Enterprise 

In version 18.09, the Docker Enterprise --- Engine is aware of the license 
applied on the system. The license summary is available in the `docker info`
output on standalone or manager nodes.

For EE platform customers, when you license UCP, this same license is applied to
the underlying engines in the cluster. Docker recommends platform customers use
UCP to manage their license.

Standalone EE engines can be licensed using `docker engine activate`.

Offline activation of standalone EE engines can be performed by downloading the 
license and using the command `docker engine activate --license filename.lic`. 

Additionally, Docker is now distributing the CLI as a separate installation 
package. This gives Enterprise users the ability to install as many CLI 
packages as needed without using the Engine node licenses for client-only
systems.

> IBM Power is not supported as managers or workers.
> Microsoft Windows Server is not supported as a manager. Microsoft Windows
> Server 1803 is not supported as a worker.

### Docker Certified Infrastructure

Docker Certified Infrastructure is Dockerâ€™s prescriptive approach to deploying
Docker Enterprise on a range of infrastructure choices. Each Docker
Certified Infrastructure includes a reference architecture, automation templates,
and third-party ecosystem solution briefs.

## Docker Enterprise release cycles

Each Docker Enterprise release is supported and maintained for 24 months, and
receives security and critical bug fixes during this period.

The Docker API version is independent of the Docker platform version. We 
maintain careful API backward compatibility and deprecate APIs and features
slowly and conservatively. We remove features after deprecating them for a
period of three stable releases. Docker 1.13 introduced improved
interoperability between clients and servers using different API versions, 
including dynamic feature negotiation.

## Upgrades and support

If you're a Docker DDC or CS Engine customer, you don't need to upgrade to
Docker Enterprise to continue to get support. We will continue to support 
customers with valid subscriptions whether the subscription covers Docker
Enterprise or Commercially Supported Docker. You can choose to stay with your
current deployed version, or you can upgrade to the latest Docker Enterprise
version. For more info, see [Scope of Coverage and Maintenance Lifecycle](https://success.docker.com/Policies/Scope_of_Support).
