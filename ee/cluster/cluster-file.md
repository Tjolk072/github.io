The topics on this reference page are organized alphabetically by top-level keys
to reflect the structure of the Cluster file. Top-level keys that define
a section in the configuration file, such as `cluster`, `provider`, and `resource`,
are listed with the options that support them as sub-topics. This information
maps to the indent structure of the Cluster file.

#### vpc

If you are deploying on to AWS, by default Docker Cluster will create a new AWS
VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) for the Docker Enterprise resources. To specify an
existing VPC, a user can specify a VPC ID in the Cluster File.

```yaml
cluster:
  vpc:
    id: vpc-existing-vpc-id
```

Docker Cluster assumes the VPC CIDR is `172.31.0.0/16`, so will therefore
attempt to create AWS subnets from this range. Docker Cluster can not utilise
existing AWS subnets. To instruct Docker Cluster to provision subnets for an
alternative CIDR you can pass a new CIDR into the Cluster File.

```yaml
cluster:
  vpc:
    id: vpc-existing-vpc-id
    cidr: "192.168.0.0/16"
```

The following elements can be specified:

- `id` - (Required) The existing AWS VPC ID `vpc-xxx`
- `cidr` - If the VPC's CIDR is not the default `172.31.0.0/16` an alternative
  CIDR can be specified here.

### provider
Defines where the cluster's resources are provisioned, as well as provider-specific configuration such as tags.

{% raw %}
```yaml
provider:
  acme:
    email: ${email}
    server_url: https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
  aws:
    region: ${region}
```
{% endraw %}

#### acme
The Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) is an evolving standard for the automation of a domain-validated certificate authority. Docker Cluster uses the ACME provider to create SSL certificates that are signed by [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

The ACME provider Configuration for the ACME provider supports arguments that closely align with the [Terraform ACME provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/acme/index.html):

The following elements can be specified:
- `email`: (Required) The email to associate the certificates with.
- `server_url`: (Optional) The URL to the ACME endpoint's directory.  Default is "https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory"

#### aws
Configuration for the AWS provider supports arguments that closely align with the [Terraform AWS provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/index.html).

```yaml
aws:
  region: "us-east-1"
  tags:
    Owner: "Infra"
    Environment: "Test"
```
The following elements can be specified:
- `region` - (Required) This is the AWS region. It can be sourced from the `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` environment variables, or
  via a shared credentials file if `profile` is specified.
- `tags` - (Optional) Additional name value pairs to assign to every resource (which
 supports tagging) in the cluster.
- `access_key` - (Required) This is the AWS access key. It can be sourced from
the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` environment variable, or via
  a shared credentials file if `profile` is specified.
- `secret_key` - (Required) This is the AWS secret key. It can be sourced from
the `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variable, or
  via a shared credentials file if `profile` is specified.
- `profile` - (Optional) This is the AWS profile name as set in the shared credentials
  file.
- `assume_role` - (Optional) An `assume_role` block (documented below). Only one
  `assume_role` block can be in the configuration.
- `endpoints` - (Optional) Configuration block for customizing service endpoints. See the
[Custom Service Endpoints Guide](/docs/providers/aws/guides/custom-service-endpoints.html)
for more information about connecting to alternate AWS endpoints or AWS compatible solutions.
- `shared_credentials_file` = (Optional) This is the path to the shared
 credentials file.  If this is not set and a profile is specified,
 `~/.aws/credentials` is used.
- `token` - (Optional) Session token for validating temporary credentials.
Typically provided after successful identity federation or Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) login. With MFA login, this is the session token
provided afterwards, not the 6 digit MFA code used to get temporary
credentials.  It can also be sourced from the `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`
environment variable.
- `max_retries` - (Optional) This is the maximum number of times an API
  call is retried, in the case where requests are being throttled or
  experiencing transient failures. The delay between the subsequent API
  calls increases exponentially.
- `allowed_account_ids` - (Optional) List of allowed, white listed, AWS
  account IDs to prevent you from mistakenly using an incorrect one (and
  potentially end up destroying a live environment). Conflicts with
  `forbidden_account_ids`.
- `forbidden_account_ids` - (Optional) List of forbidden, blacklisted,
  AWS account IDs to prevent you mistakenly using a wrong one (and
  potentially end up destroying a live environment). Conflicts with
  `allowed_account_ids`.
- `insecure` - (Optional) Explicitly allows the provider to
  perform "insecure" SSL requests. If omitted, defaults to `false`.
- `skip_credentials_validation` - (Optional) Skips the credentials
  validation via the STS API. Useful for AWS API implementations that do
  not have STS available or implemented.
- `skip_get_ec2_platforms` - (Optional) Skips getting the supported EC2
  platforms. Used by users that don't have `ec2:DescribeAccountAttributes`
  permissions.
- `skip_region_validation` - (Optional) Skips validation of provided region name.
  Useful for AWS-like implementations that use their own region names
  or to bypass the validation for regions that aren't publicly available yet.

### resource
Resources to provision for a cluster.  Resources are organized as shown in the following example:

```yaml
resource:
  type:
    name:
      parameters
```
For a given `type`, there may be more one or more named resources to provision.

For a given `name`, a resource may have one or more parameters.

    > Note
    > 
    > Make sure the OS you select is [compatible](https://success.docker.com/article/compatibility-matrix)
    with the product you're installing. Docker Cluster validates the support during installation.
- `instance_type`: Specifies the [AWS instance type](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) to provision.
- `key_name`: By default, Docker Cluster creates an [AWS EC2 Key Pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html) and registers it with AWS for the cluster.
To use an existing AWS EC2 Key Pair, set this value to the name of the AWS EC2 Key Pair.
- `ssh_private_key`: By default, Docker Cluster creates an [AWS EC2 Key Pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html) and registers it with AWS for the cluster. To use an existing AWS EC2 Key Pair, set this value to the path of the private SSH key.
- `username`: Specifies the username for the node with Administrative privileges. By default, the `os` option
sets this to the well-known username for the AMIs (which can change by distribution):
    - Amazon Linux 2 is `ec2-user`.
    - Centos is `centos`.
    - Oracle Linux is `ec2-user`.
    - RedHat is `ec2-user`.
    - SLES is `ec2-user`.

- `tags`: (Optional) Specifies additional name value pairs to assign to every instance.
- `swarm_labels`: (Optional) Specifies additional key value pairs that represent swarm labels to apply to every node.

#### aws_spot_instance_request

Provisions a spot instance request in AWS to dramatically reduce the cost of instances. Spot instance
availability is not guaranteed. Therefore, it is recommended to use `aws_spot_instance_request` for
additional worker nodes and not for mission-critical nodes like managers and registry.

```yaml
resource:
  aws_spot_instance_request:
    workers:
      instance_type: t2.xlarge
      price: 0.25
      os: Ubuntu 16.04
      quantity: 3
```

Supports the same set of parameters as [aws_instance](index.md#aws_instance), with the addition of an optional price to limit the max bid for a spot instance.
- `price`: (Optional) Specifies a maximum price to bid on the spot instance.

#### aws_lb
Provisions an AWS Load Balancer.
```yaml
resource:
  aws_lb:
    ucp:
      domain: "example.com"
      instances:
      - managers
      ports:
      - 443:443
      - 6443:6443
```
The following options are supported:

- `instances`: (Required) Specifies a list of `aws_instance` and `aws_spot_instance_request` names to
attach to the load balancer.
- `ports`: (Required) Specifies a list of `listening port[/protocol]:target port[/protocol]` mappings
to define how the load balancer should route traffic. By default, the protocol is `tcp`.
- `domain`: Specifies the domain in which to create DNS records for this load balancer. The record is named the
same as this resource, appended by the domain. For example, if the resource is `ucp` and the domain is `example.com`,
the `A` record is `ucp.example.com`.
- `internal`: (Optional) Defaults to `false`.
- `type`: (Optional) Defaults to `network`.
- `enable_cross_zone_load_balancing`: (Optional) Defaults to `false`.

#### aws_route53_zone
Creates a subdomain in an AWS route53 zone. The following example creates a public zone for `testing.example.com`:

```yaml
resource:
  aws_route53_zone:
    dns:
      domain: example.com
      subdomain: testing
```
The following elements are required:
- `domain`: (Required) Specifies the name of the hosted zone.
- `subdomain`: (Required) Specifies the subdomain to create in the `domain` hosted zone.

### variable
Docker cluster supports basic parameterization. The variable section defines a make of keys and values. A key can have a sub-key named `type`, which changes the behavior of the variable.

```yaml
variable:
  region: "us-east-1"
  password:
    prompt: true
  instance_type:
    env: AWS_INSTANCE_TYPE
```

Variables are referenced in the cluster definition as `${variable_name}`. For
example, `${region}` is substituted as `us-east-2` through the cluster
definition.

In addition to providing a literal value for variables, you can specify values
by:

 - `prompt: true` - Request the value from the user and do not echo characters
   as the value is entered.
 - `env`: Obtain the value from an environment variable
