This document describes the latest changes, additions, known issues, and fixes
for Docker Engine - Enterprise.

Docker Engine - Enterprise builds upon the corresponding Docker Engine -
Community that it references. Docker Engine - Enterprise includes enterprise
features as well as back-ported fixes (security-related and priority defects)
from the open source. It also incorporates defect fixes for environments in
which new features cannot be adopted as quickly for consistency and
compatibility reasons.

> **Note:**
> New in 18.09 is an aligned release model for Docker Engine - Community and
> Docker Engine - Enterprise. The new versioning scheme is YY.MM.x where x is an
> incrementing patch version. The enterprise engine is a superset of the
> community engine. They will ship concurrently with the same x patch version
> based on the same code base.

> **Note:**
> The client and container runtime are now in separate packages from the daemon
> in Docker Engine 18.09. Users should install and update all three packages at
> the same time to get the latest patch releases. For example, on Ubuntu:
> `sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io`. See the install
> instructions for the corresponding linux distro for details.

# Version 19.03

## 19.03.5
2019-11-14

### Builder

* builder-next: Added `entitlements` in builder config. [docker/engine#412](https://github.com/docker/engine/pull/412)
* Fix builder-next: permission errors on using build secrets or ssh forwarding with userns-remap. [docker/engine#420](https://github.com/docker/engine/pull/420)
* Fix builder-next: copying a symlink inside an already copied directory. [docker/engine#420](https://github.com/docker/engine/pull/420)

### Packaging

* Support RHEL 8 packages

### Runtime

* Bump Golang to 1.12.12. [docker/engine#418](https://github.com/docker/engine/pull/418)
* Update to RootlessKit to v0.7.0 to harden slirp4netns with mount namespace and seccomp. [docker/engine#397](https://github.com/docker/engine/pull/397)
* Fix to propagate GetContainer error from event processor. [docker/engine#407](https://github.com/docker/engine/pull/407)
* Fix push of OCI image. [docker/engine#405](https://github.com/docker/engine/pull/405)

## 19.03.4
2019-10-17

### Networking

* Rollback libnetwork changes to fix `DOCKER-USER` iptables chain issue. [docker/engine#404](https://github.com/docker/engine/pull/404)

### Known Issues

#### Existing

* In some circumstances with large clusters, Docker information might, as part of the Swarm section,
  include the error `code = ResourceExhausted desc = grpc: received message larger than
  max (5351376 vs. 4194304)`. This does not indicate any failure or misconfiguration by the user,
  and requires no response.
* Orchestrator port conflict can occur when redeploying all services as new. Due to many Swarm manager
  requests in a short amount of time, some services are not able to receive traffic and are causing a `404`
  error after being deployed.
     - **Workaround:** restart all tasks via `docker service update --force`.
* [CVE-2018-15664](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15664) symlink-exchange attack with directory traversal. Workaround until proper fix is available in upcoming patch release: `docker pause` container before doing file operations. [moby/moby#39252](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/39252)
* `docker cp` regression due to CVE mitigation. An error is produced when the source of `docker cp` is set to `/`.
* Install Docker Engine - Enterprise fails to install on RHEL on Azure. This affects any RHEL version that uses an Extended Update Support (EUS) image. At the time of this writing, known versions affected are RHEL 7.4, 7.5, and 7.6.

     - **Workaround options:**
         - Use an older image and don't get updates. Examples of EUS images are here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/rhel-images#rhel-images-with-eus.
         - Import your own RHEL images into Azure and do not rely on the Extended Update Support (EUS) RHEL images.
         - Use a RHEL image that does not contain a minor version in the SKU. These are not attached to EUS repositories. Some examples of those are the first three images (SKUs: 7-RAW, 7-LVM, 7-RAW-CI) listed here : https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/rhel-images#list-of-rhel-images-available.

### Known Issues

#### New

* `DOCKER-USER` iptables chain is missing: [docker/for-linux#810](https://github.com/docker/for-linux/issues/810).
  Users cannot perform additional container network traffic filtering on top of
  this iptables chain. You are not affected by this issue if you are not
  customizing iptable chains on top of `DOCKER-USER`.
     - **Workaround:** Insert the iptables chain after the docker daemon starts.
       For example:
       ```
       iptables -N DOCKER-USER
       iptables -I FORWARD -j DOCKER-USER
       iptables -A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN
       ```

#### Existing

* In some circumstances with large clusters, docker information might, as part of the Swarm section,
  include the error `code = ResourceExhausted desc = grpc: received message larger than
  max (5351376 vs. 4194304)`. This does not indicate any failure or misconfiguration by the user,
  and requires no response.
* Orchestrator port conflict can occur when redeploying all services as new. Due to many swarm manager
  requests in a short amount of time, some services are not able to receive traffic and are causing a `404`
  error after being deployed.
     - **Workaround:** restart all tasks via `docker service update --force`.
* [CVE-2018-15664](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15664) symlink-exchange attack with directory traversal. Workaround until proper fix is available in upcoming patch release: `docker pause` container before doing file operations. [moby/moby#39252](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/39252)
* `docker cp` regression due to CVE mitigation. An error is produced when the source of `docker cp` is set to `/`.
* Install Docker Engine - Enterprise fails to install on RHEL on Azure. This affects any RHEL version that uses an Extended Update Support (EUS) image. At the time of this writing, known versions affected are RHEL 7.4, 7.5, and 7.6.

     - **Workaround options:**
         - Use an older image and don't get updates. Examples of EUS images are here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/rhel-images#rhel-images-with-eus.
         - Import your own RHEL images into Azure and do not rely on the Extended Update Support (EUS) RHEL images.
         - Use a RHEL image that does not contain a minor version in the SKU. These are not attached to EUS repositories. Some examples of those are the first three images (SKUs: 7-RAW, 7-LVM, 7-RAW-CI) listed here : https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/rhel-images#list-of-rhel-images-available.

### Swarm

* Fix an issue where nodes with several tasks could not be removed. [docker/swarmkit#2867](https://github.com/docker/swarmkit/pull/2867)

### Known issues

* In some circumstances with large clusters, docker information might, as part of the Swarm section,
  include the error `code = ResourceExhausted desc = grpc: received message larger than
  max (5351376 vs. 4194304)`. This does not indicate any failure or misconfiguration by the user,
  and requires no response.
* Orchestrator port conflict can occur when redeploying all services as new. Due to many swarm manager
  requests in a short amount of time, some services are not able to receive traffic and are causing a `404`
  error after being deployed.
     - Workaround: restart all tasks via `docker service update --force`.

* Traffic cannot egress the HOST because of missing Iptables rules in the FORWARD chain
  The missing rules are :
     ```
     /sbin/iptables --wait -C FORWARD -o docker_gwbridge -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
     /sbin/iptables --wait -C FORWARD -o docker0 -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
     ```
     - Workaround: Add these rules back using a script and cron definitions. The script
     must contain '-C' commands to check for the presence of a rule and '-A' commands to add
     rules back. Run the script on a cron in regular intervals, for example, every <x> minutes.
     - Affected versions: 17.06.2-ee-16, 18.09.1, 19.03.0
* [CVE-2018-15664](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15664) symlink-exchange attack with directory traversal. Workaround until proper fix is available in upcoming patch release: `docker pause` container before doing file operations. [moby/moby#39252](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/39252)

For more information on deprecated flags and APIs, refer to
https://docs.docker.com/engine/deprecated/ for target removal dates.

### Known issues

* In some circumstances with large clusters, docker information might, as part of the Swarm section,
include the error `code = ResourceExhausted desc = grpc: received message larger than
max (5351376 vs. 4194304)`. This does not indicate any failure or misconfiguration by the user,
and requires no response.
* Orchestrator port conflict can occur when redeploying all services as new. Due to many swarm manager
requests in a short amount of time, some services are not able to receive traffic and are causing a `404`
error after being deployed.
   - Workaround: restart all tasks via `docker service update --force`.

* Traffic cannot egress the HOST because of missing Iptables rules in the FORWARD chain
The missing rules are :
    ```
    /sbin/iptables --wait -C FORWARD -o docker_gwbridge -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
    /sbin/iptables --wait -C FORWARD -o docker0 -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
    ```
    - Workaround: Add these rules back using a script and cron definitions. The script
    must contain '-C' commands to check for the presence of a rule and '-A' commands to add
    rules back. Run the script on a cron in regular intervals, for example, every <x> minutes.
    - Affected versions: 17.06.2-ee-16, 18.09.1, 19.03.0
* [CVE-2018-15664](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15664) symlink-exchange attack with directory traversal. Workaround until proper fix is available in upcoming patch release: `docker pause` container before doing file operations. [moby/moby#39252](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/39252)
* `docker cp` regression due to CVE mitigation. An error is produced when the source of `docker cp` is set to `/`.
* Install Docker Engine - Enterprise fails to install on RHEL on Azure. This affects any RHEL version that uses an Extended Update Support (EUS) image. At the time of this writing, known versions affected are RHEL 7.4, 7.5, and 7.6.

    - Workaround options:
        - Use an older image and don't get updates. Examples of EUS images are here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/rhel-images#rhel-images-with-eus.
        - Import your own RHEL images into Azure and do not rely on the Extended Update Support (EUS) RHEL images.
        - Use a RHEL image that does not contain a minor version in the SKU. These are not attached to EUS repositories. Some examples of those are the first three images (SKUs: 7-RAW, 7-LVM, 7-RAW-CI) listed here : https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/rhel-images#list-of-rhel-images-available.

## 18.09.1

2019-01-09

#### Important notes about this release

In Docker versions prior to 18.09, containerd was managed by the Docker engine daemon. In Docker Engine 18.09, containerd is managed by systemd. Since containerd is managed by systemd, any custom configuration to the `docker.service` systemd configuration which changes mount settings (for example, `MountFlags=slave`) breaks interactions between the Docker Engine daemon and containerd, and you will not be able to start containers.

Run the following command to get the current value of the `MountFlags` property for the `docker.service`:

```bash
sudo systemctl show --property=MountFlags docker.service
MountFlags=
```
Update your configuration if this command prints a non-empty value for `MountFlags`, and restart the docker service.

### Security fixes for Docker Engine EE and CE

### Known Issues
* When upgrading from 18.09.0 to 18.09.1, `containerd` is not upgraded to the correct version on Ubuntu.  [Learn more](https://success.docker.com/article/error-upgrading-to-engine-18091-with-containerd).
* There are [important changes to the upgrade process](/ee/upgrade) that, if not correctly followed, can have impact on the availability of applications running on the Swarm during upgrades. These constraints impact any upgrades coming from any version before 18.09 to version 18.09 or greater.

## 18.09.0

2018-11-08

### Important notes about this release

In Docker versions prior to 18.09, containerd was managed by the Docker engine daemon. In Docker Engine 18.09, containerd is managed by systemd. Since containerd is managed by systemd, any custom configuration to the `docker.service` systemd
configuration which changes mount settings (for example, `MountFlags=slave`) breaks interactions between the Docker Engine daemon and containerd, and you will not be able to start containers.

Run the following command to get the current value of the `MountFlags` property for the `docker.service`:

```bash
sudo systemctl show --property=MountFlags docker.service
MountFlags=
```

Update your configuration if this command prints a non-empty value for `MountFlags`, and restart the docker service.

### Known Issues

* There are [important changes to the upgrade process](/ee/upgrade) that, if not correctly followed, can have impact on the availability of applications running on the Swarm during upgrades. These constraints impact any upgrades coming from any version before 18.09 to version 18.09 or greater.
* With https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker/releases/download/v18.09.0/boot2docker.iso, connection is being refused from a node on the virtual machine. Any publishing of swarm ports in virtualbox-created docker-machine VM's will not respond. This is occurring on macOS and Windows 10, using docker-machine version 0.15 and 0.16.

   The following `docker run` command works, allowing access from host browser:

   `docker run -d -p 4000:80 nginx`

   However, the following `docker service` command fails, resulting in curl/chrome unable to connect (connection refused):

   `docker service create -p 5000:80 nginx`

   This issue is not apparent when provisioning 18.09.0 cloud VM's using docker-machine.

   Workarounds:
   * Use cloud VM's that don't rely on boot2docker.
   * `docker run` is unaffected.
   * For Swarm, set VIRTUALBOX_BOOT2DOCKER_URL=https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker/releases/download/v18.06.1-ce/boot2docker.iso.

   This issue is resolved in 18.09.1.

### Deprecation Notices

- As of EE 2.1, Docker has deprecated support for Device Mapper as a storage driver. It will continue to be
supported at this time, but support will be removed in a future release. Docker will continue to support
Device Mapper for existing EE 2.0 and 2.1 customers. Please contact Sales for more information.

    Docker recommends that existing customers
    [migrate to using Overlay2 for the storage driver](https://success.docker.com/article/how-do-i-migrate-an-existing-ucp-cluster-to-the-overlay2-graph-driver). The [Overlay2 storage driver](https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/overlayfs-driver/) is now the default for Docker engine implementations.
- As of EE 2.1, Docker has deprecated support for IBM Z (s390x). Refer to the
[Docker Compatibility Matrix](https://success.docker.com/article/compatibility-matrix) for detailed
compatibility information.

For more information on the list of deprecated flags and APIs, have a look at the [deprecation information](https://docs.docker.com/engine/deprecated/) where you can find the target removal dates.

### End of Life Notification

In this release, Docker has also removed support for TLS < 1.2 [moby/moby#37660](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/37660),
Ubuntu 14.04 "Trusty Tahr" [docker-ce-packaging#255](https://github.com/docker/docker-ce-packaging/pull/255) / [docker-ce-packaging#254](https://github.com/docker/docker-ce-packaging/pull/254), and Debian 8 "Jessie" [docker-ce-packaging#255](https://github.com/docker/docker-ce-packaging/pull/255) / [docker-ce-packaging#254](https://github.com/docker/docker-ce-packaging/pull/254).

### Known issues

* When all Swarm managers are stopped at the same time, the swarm might end up in a
split-brain scenario. [Learn more](https://success.docker.com/article/KB000759).
* Under certain conditions, swarm leader re-election may timeout
  prematurely. During this period, docker commands may fail. Also during
  this time, creation of globally-scoped networks may be unstable. As a
  workaround, wait for leader election to complete before issuing commands
  to the cluster.
* It's recommended that users create overlay networks with `/24` blocks (the default) of 256 IP addresses when networks are used by services created using VIP-based endpoint-mode (the default). This is because of limitations with Docker Swarm [moby/moby#30820](moby/moby/issues/30820). Users should _not_ work around this by increasing the IP block size. To work around this limitation, either use `dnsrr` endpoint-mode or use multiple smaller overlay networks.
* Docker may experience IP exhaustion if many tasks are assigned to a single overlay network, for example if many services are attached to that network or because services on the network are scaled to many replicas. The problem may also manifest when tasks are rescheduled because of node failures. In case of node failure, Docker currently waits 24h to release overlay IP addresses. The problem can be diagnosed by looking for `failed to allocate network IP for task` messages in the Docker logs.
* SELinux enablement is not supported for containers on IBM Z on RHEL because of missing Red Hat package.
* If a container is spawned on node A, using the same IP of a container destroyed
on nodeB within 5 min from the time that it exit, the container on node A is
not reachable until one of these 2 conditions happens:

1. Container on A sends a packet out,
2. The timer that cleans the arp entry in the overlay namespace is triggered (around 5 minutes).

As a workaround, send at least a packet out from each container like
(ping, GARP, etc).

## 17.06.2-ee-22
2019-06-27

### Networking

* Fixed a bug where if a service has the same number of host-mode published ports with PublishedPort 0, changes to the spec is not reflected in the service object. [docker/swarmkit#2376](https://github.com/docker/swarmkit/pull/2376)

### Runtime

* Added performance optimizations in aufs and layer store that helps in the creation and removal of massively parallel containers. [moby/moby#39107](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/39107)

* It's recommended that users create overlay networks with `/24` blocks (the default) of 256 IP addresses when networks are used by services created using VIP-based endpoint-mode (the default). This is because of limitations with Docker Swarm [moby/moby#30820](moby/moby/issues/30820). Users should _not_ work around this by increasing the IP block size. To work around this limitation, either use `dnsrr` endpoint-mode or use multiple smaller overlay networks.
* Docker may experience IP exhaustion if many tasks are assigned to a single overlay network, for example if many services are attached to that network or because services on the network are scaled to many replicas. The problem may also manifest when tasks are rescheduled because of node failures. In case of node failure, Docker currently waits 24h to release overlay IP addresses. The problem can be diagnosed by looking for `failed to allocate network IP for task` messages in the Docker logs.
* SELinux enablement is not supported for containers on IBM Z on RHEL because of missing Red Hat package.
* If a container is spawned on node A, using the same IP of a container destroyed
on nodeB within 5 min from the time that it exit, the container on node A is
not reachable until one of these 2 conditions happens:

1. Container on A sends a packet out,
2. The timer that cleans the arp entry in the overlay namespace is triggered (around 5 minutes).

As a workaround, send at least a packet out from each container like
(ping, GARP, etc).

+ Add support for Windows version filtering on pull of docker image [moby/moby#35090](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/35090)

#### Swarm mode

* Increase gRPC request timeout to 20 seconds for sending snapshots to prevent `context deadline exceeded` errors [docker/swarmkit#2391](https://github.com/docker/swarmkit/pull/2391)
* When a node is removed, delete all of its attachment tasks so networks used by those tasks can be removed [docker/swarmkit#2414](https://github.com/docker/swarmkit/pull/2414)

#### Known issues

 * It's recommended that users create overlay networks with `/24` blocks (the default) of 256 IP addresses when networks are used by services created using VIP-based endpoint-mode (the default). This is because of limitations with Docker Swarm [moby/moby#30820](moby/moby/issues/30820). Users should _not_ work around this by increasing the IP block size. To work around this limitation, either use `dnsrr` endpoint-mode or use multiple smaller overlay networks.
 * Docker may experience IP exhaustion if many tasks are assigned to a single overlay network, for example if many services are attached to that network or because services on the network are scaled to many replicas. The problem may also manifest when tasks are rescheduled because of node failures. In case of node failure, Docker currently waits 24h to release overlay IP addresses. The problem can be diagnosed by looking for `failed to allocate network IP for task` messages in the Docker logs.
* SELinux enablement is not supported for containers on IBM Z on RHEL because of missing Red Hat package.
* If a container is spawned on node A, using the same IP of a container destroyed
on nodeB within 5 min from the time that it exit, the container on node A is
not reachable until one of these 2 conditions happens:

1. Container on A sends a packet out,
2. The timer that cleans the arp entry in the overlay namespace is triggered (around 5 minutes).

As a workaround, send at least a packet out from each container like
(ping, GARP, etc).

## 17.06.1-ee-1
2017-08-16

### Important notes about this release

- Starting with Docker EE 17.06.1, Ubuntu, SLES, RHEL packages are also available
  for IBM Z using the s390x architecture.

- Docker EE 17.06.1 includes a new [telemetry plugin](/enterprise/telemetry/)
  which is enabled by default on Ubuntu hosts. For more details, including how to
  opt out, see [the documentation(/enterprise/telemetry/).

- Docker 17.06 by default disables communication with legacy (v1)
  registries. If you require interaction with registries that have not yet
  migrated to the v2 protocol, set the `--disable-legacy-registry=false` daemon
  option.

### Known issues

If a container is spawned on node A, using the same IP of a container destroyed
on nodeB within 5 min from the time that it exit, the container on node A is
not reachable until one of these 2 conditions happens:

1. Container on A sends a packet out,
2. The timer that cleans the arp entry in the overlay namespace is triggered (around 5 minutes).

As a workaround, send at least a packet out from each container like
(ping, GARP, etc).

2017-06-28

> **Note**: Docker 17.06.0 has an issue in the image builder causing a change in the behavior
> of the `ADD` instruction of Dockerfile when referencing a remote `.tar.gz` file. The issue will be
> fixed in Docker 17.06.1.

> **Note**: Starting with Docker CE 17.06, Ubuntu packages are also available
> for IBM Z using the s390x architecture.

> **Note**: Docker 17.06 by default disables communication with legacy (v1)
> registries. If you require interaction with registries that have not yet
> migrated to the v2 protocol, set the `--disable-legacy-registry=false` daemon
> option. Interaction with v1 registries will be removed in Docker 17.12.

## 17.03.0-ce
2017-03-01

**IMPORTANT**: Starting with this release, Docker is on a monthly release cycle and uses a
new YY.MM versioning scheme to reflect this. Two channels are available: monthly and quarterly.
Any given monthly release will only receive security and bugfixes until the next monthly
release is available. Quarterly releases receive security and bugfixes for 4 months after
initial release. This release includes bugfixes for 1.13.1 but
there are no major feature additions and the API version stays the same.
Upgrading from Docker 1.13.1 to 17.03.0 is expected to be simple and low-risk.

## 17.11.0-ce
2017-11-20

> **Important**: Docker CE 17.11 is the first Docker release based on
[containerd 1.0 beta](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.2).
Docker CE 17.11 and later don't recognize containers started with
previous Docker versions. If using
[Live Restore](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/live-restore/#enable-the-live-restore-option),
you must stop all containers before upgrading to Docker CE 17.11.
If you don't, any containers started by Docker versions that predate
17.11 aren't recognized by Docker after the upgrade and keep
running, un-managed, on the system.
