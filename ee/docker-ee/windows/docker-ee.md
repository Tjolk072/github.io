## System requirements

Windows OS requirements around specific CPU and RAM requirements also need to be
met as specified in the [Windows Server
Requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/get-started/system-requirements).
This provides information for specific CPU and memory specs and capabilities
(instruction sets like CMPXCHG16b, LAHF/SAHF, and PrefetchW, security: DEP/NX,
etc.).

* OS Versions:
  - Long Term Service Channel (LTSC) - 2016 and 2019 (Core and GUI)
  - Semi-annual Channel (SAC) - 1709, 1803 and 1809
* RAM: 4GB
* Disk space: [32 GB minimum recommendation for Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/get-started/system-requirements).
  Docker recommends an additional 32 GB of space for base images for ServerCore
  and NanoServer along with buffer space for workload containers running IIS,
  SQL Server and .Net apps.


## Install Docker Engine - Enterprise

To install the Docker Engine - Enterprise on your hosts, Docker provides a
[OneGet](https://github.com/oneget/oneget) PowerShell Module.

1.  Open an elevated PowerShell command prompt, and type the following commands.

    ```powershell
    Install-Module DockerMsftProvider -Force
    Install-Package Docker -ProviderName DockerMsftProvider -Force
    ```

2.  Check if a reboot is required, and if yes, restart your instance.

    ```powershell
    (Install-WindowsFeature Containers).RestartNeeded
    ```
    If the output of this command is **Yes**, then restart the server with:

    ```powershell
    Restart-Computer
    ```

3.  Test your Docker Engine - Enterprise installation by running the
    `hello-world` container.

    **Windows Server 2019**

    ```powershell
    docker run hello-world:nanoserver
    ```

    **Windows Server 2016**

    ```powershell
    docker run hello-world:nanoserver-sac2016
    ```

    The container starts, prints the hello message, and then exits.

    ```
    Unable to find image 'hello-world:nanoserver' locally

    bce2fbc256ea: Pull complete
    3ac17e2e6106: Pull complete
    8cac44e17f16: Pull complete
    5e160e4d8db3: Pull complete
    Digest: sha256:25eac12ba40f7591969085ab3fb9772e8a4307553c14ea72d0e6f98b2c8ced9d
    Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:nanoserver

    Hello from Docker!
    This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
    ```

### (optional) Make sure you have all required updates

Some advanced Docker features, such as swarm mode, require the fixes included in
[KB4015217](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4015217/windows-10-update-kb4015217)
(or a later cumulative patch).

```powershell
sconfig
```

Select option `6) Download and Install Updates`.


### FIPS 140-2 cryptographic module support

[Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) Publication
140-2](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/publications/fips/140/2/final/documents/fips1402.pdf)
is a United States Federal security requirement for cryptographic modules.

With Docker Engine - Enterprise Basic license for versions 18.09 and later,
Docker provides FIPS 140-2 support in Windows Server. This includes a FIPS
supported cryptographic module. If the Windows implementation already has FIPS
support enabled, FIPS is automatically enabled in the Docker engine.


> **Note:** FIPS 140-2 is only supported in the Docker Engine - Enterprise
> engine. UCP and DTR currently do not have support for FIPS 140-2.

To enable FIPS 140-2 compliance on a system that is not in FIPS 140-2 mode,
execute the following command in PowerShell:

```powershell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("DOCKER_FIPS", "1", "Machine")
```

FIPS 140-2 mode may also be enabled via the Windows Registry. To update the
pertinent registry key, execute the following PowerShell command as an
Administrator:

```powershell
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\FipsAlgorithmPolicy\" -Name "Enabled" -Value "1"
```

Restart the Docker service by running the following command.

```powershell
net stop docker
net start docker
```

To confirm Docker is running with FIPS-140-2 enabled, run the `docker info` command:

```yaml
Labels:
 com.docker.security.fips=enabled
```

> **Note:** If the system has the FIPS-140-2 cryptographic module installed on
> the operating system, it is possible to disable FIPS-140-2 compliance. To
> disable FIPS-140-2 in Docker but not the operating system, set the value
> `"DOCKER_FIPS","0"` in the `[System.Environment]`.`

## Use a script to install Docker Engine - Enterprise

Use the following guide if you wanted to install the Docker Engine - Enterprise
manually, via a script, or on air-gapped systems.

1.  In a PowerShell command prompt, download the installer archive on a machine
    that has a connection.

    ```powershell
    # On an online machine, download the zip file.
    Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -OutFile {{ filename }} {{ download_url }}
    ```

    If you need to download a specific Docker Engine - Enterprise Engine
    release, all URLs can be found on this [JSON index](https://dockermsft.blob.core.windows.net/dockercontainer/DockerMsftIndex.json)

2.  Copy the zip file to the machine where you want to install Docker. In a
    PowerShell command prompt, use the following commands to extract the archive,
    register, and start the Docker service.

    ```powershell
    # Stop Docker service
    Stop-Service docker

    # Extract the archive.
    Expand-Archive {{ filename }} -DestinationPath $Env:ProgramFiles -Force

    # Clean up the zip file.
    Remove-Item -Force {{ filename }}

    # Install Docker. This requires rebooting.
    $null = Install-WindowsFeature containers

    # Add Docker to the path for the current session.
    $env:path += ";$env:ProgramFiles\docker"

    # Optionally, modify PATH to persist across sessions.
    $newPath = "$env:ProgramFiles\docker;" +
    [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("PATH",
    [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Machine)

    [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", $newPath,
    [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Machine)

    # Register the Docker daemon as a service.
    dockerd --register-service

    # Start the Docker service.
    Start-Service docker
    ```

3.  Test your Docker Engine - Enterprise installation by running the
    `hello-world` container.

    **Windows Server 2019**

    ```powershell
    docker container run hello-world:nanoserver
    ```

    **Windows Server 2016**

    ```powershell
    docker container run hello-world:nanoserver-sac2016
    ```

## Install a specific version

To install a specific version, use the `RequiredVersion` flag:

```powershell
Install-Package -Name docker -ProviderName DockerMsftProvider -Force -RequiredVersion {{ site.docker_ee_version }}
...
Name                      Version               Source           Summary
----                      -------               ------           -------
Docker                    {{ site.docker_ee_version }}                 Docker           Contains Docker Engine - Enterprise for use with Windows Server...
```

### Updating the DockerMsftProvider

Installing specific Docker Engine - Enterprise versions may require an update to
previously installed DockerMsftProvider modules. To update:

```powershell
Update-Module DockerMsftProvider
```

Then open a new PowerShell session for the update to take effect.

## Update Docker Engine - Enterprise

To update Docker Engine - Enterprise to the most recent release, specify the
`-RequiredVersion` and `-Update` flags:

```powershell
Install-Package -Name docker -ProviderName DockerMsftProvider -RequiredVersion {{ site.docker_ee_version }} -Update -Force
```
The required version number must match a version available on the [JSON
index](https://dockermsft.blob.core.windows.net/dockercontainer/DockerMsftIndex.json)

## Uninstall Docker Engine - Enterprise

Use the following commands to completely remove the Docker Engine - Enterprise
from a Windows Server:

1. Leave any active Docker Swarm.

    ```powershell
    docker swarm leave --force
    ```

2. Remove all running and stopped containers.

    ```powershell
    docker rm -f $(docker ps --all --quiet)
    ```

3. Prune container data.

    ```powershell
    docker system prune --all --volumes
    ```

4. Uninstall Docker PowerShell Package and Module.

    ```powershell
    Uninstall-Package -Name docker -ProviderName DockerMsftProvider
    Uninstall-Module -Name DockerMsftProvider
    ```

5. Clean up Windows Networking and file system.

    ```powershell
    Get-HNSNetwork | Remove-HNSNetwork
    Remove-Item -Path "C:\ProgramData\Docker" -Recurse -Force
    ```
