---

[NIST Interagency Report (NISTIR)
8176](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8176/final), *Security
Assurance Requiements for Linux Application Container Deployments*, is a
detailed report that highlights the effectiveness of application container
security on Linux-based infrastructure. It demonstrates the use of container
security configurations at various layers of the stack; from hardware root of
trust, to host OS kernel, container runtime configuration, and the containerized
software supply chain. The report is a complement to [NIST SP
800-190](800_190.md) and [NIST ITL Bulletin October 2017](itl_october2017.md)
and is not specific to any one container runtime.
