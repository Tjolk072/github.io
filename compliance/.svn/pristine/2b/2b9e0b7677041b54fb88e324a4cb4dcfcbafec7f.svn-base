#### Description

The organization:
<ol type="a">
<li>Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]:</li>

<ol type="1">
<li>An identification and authentication policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and</li>
<li>Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the identification and authentication policy and associated identification and authentication controls; and</li>
</ol>
<li>Reviews and updates the current:</li>

<ol type="1">
<li>Identification and authentication policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and</li>

Docker Enterprise Edition can be configured to identify and
authenticate users via it&#39;s integrated support for LDAP. Users and
groups managed within the organization&#39;s LDAP directory service (e.g.
Active Directory) can be synchronized to UCP and DTR on a regular
interval. When a user is removed from the LDAP-backed directory, that
user becomes inactive within UCP and DTR. In addition, UCP and DTR
teams can be mapped to groups synchronized via LDAP. When a user is
added/removed to/from the LDAP group, that same user is automatically
added/removed to/from the UCP and DTR team. Additional information can
be found at the following resources:

Docker Trusted Registry includes a Docker volume which holds the root
key material for the DTR root CA that issues certificats. In addition
Universal Control Plane contains two, built-in root certificate
authorities. One CA is used for signing client bundles generated by
users. The other CA is used for TLS communication between UCP cluster
nodes. Should you choose to use certificates signed by an external CA,
in order to successfully authenticate in to the system, those
certificates must include a root CA public certificate, a service
certificate and any intermediate CA public certificates (in addition
to SANs for all addresses used to reach the UCP controller), and a
private key for the server. When adding DTR replicas, the UCP nodes on
which they&#39;re installed are authenticated to the cluster via the
appropriate built-in CA.Access to Docker Trusted Registry is only granted when a user has a
valid certificate bundle. This is enforced with the public/private key
pair included with the user&#39;s certificate bundle in Universal Control
Plane.Only after a client bundle has been generated or an existing public
key has been added for a particular user is that user able to execute
commands against Docker Trusted Registry. This bundle maps the
authenticated identity to that of the user&#39;s profile in Universal
Control Plane.When a client bundle has been generated or an existing public key has
been added for a particular Universal Control Plane user which
subsequently grants that user access to Docker Trusted Registry, it is

can be revoked by an Administrator or the user themselves. The
