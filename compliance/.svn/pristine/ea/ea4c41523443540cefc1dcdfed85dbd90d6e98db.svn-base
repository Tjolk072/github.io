The NIST [Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) Bulletin dated October
2017](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/itl-bulletin/2017/10/application-container-security/final),
*NIST Guidance on Application Container Security*, is a summarization of the
content made available in [NIST SP 800-190](800_190.md) and [NISTIR
8176](nistir_8176.md). It provides a fundamental high-level starting point from
which to evaluate the primary security enhancements that containers provide. It
is not specific to any one container runtime.
