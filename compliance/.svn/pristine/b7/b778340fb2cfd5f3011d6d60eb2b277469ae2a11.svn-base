Docker maintains an [open source
repository](https://github.com/docker/compliance) where you can find a number of
machine-readable compliance resources in addition to the source of this
documentation. This repository also includes tools for automatically generating
security documentation and auditing Docker Enterprise Edition systems against
the security controls. An experimental natural language processing (NLP) utility
is also included, for proofreading security narratives.
