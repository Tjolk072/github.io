keywords: standards, compliance, security
title: Docker standards and compliance

We want to ensure that Docker Enterprise Edition can be used in a manner that meets the requirements of various security and compliance standards. You can use this documentation in order to validate your Docker Enterprise Edition deployment against applicable security controls and configuration baselines. The documents that we've highlighted thus far are as follows:

- [NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 Revision 4](nist/800_53.md)
- [Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)](fedramp.md)
- [CIS Docker Benchmark](cis.md)

Docker also maintains an open source repository at [https://github.com/docker/compliance](https://github.com/docker/compliance) where you can find a number of compliance resources. These include tools for auto-generating security documentation, auditing Docker Enterprise Edition systems against the security controls and even an experimental natural language processing utility for proofreading security narratives.
