Docker Content Trust is a capability provided by Docker Enterprise
Edition that enforces client-side signing and verification of Docker
image tags. It provides the ability to use digital signatures for data
sent to and received from Docker Trusted Registry and the public
Docker Store. These signatures allow client-side verification of the
integrity and publisher of specific image tags. All Docker Trusted
Registry Docker images are officially signed and verified by Docker,
Inc.

When installing Docker Trusted Registry, you should enable Docker
Content Trust and subsequently pull the the signed DTR image tag.

Before installing Docker Enterprise Edition, ensure that your
supporting Linux operating system&#39;s packager manager supports package
signature verification and that it is enabled. It is also required
that you import the Docker public key for EE packages so as to
retrieve the validated and signed package from Docker, Inc. Refer to
your Linux OS documentation for instructions on completing the above
steps.

In addition, Docker Content Trust is a capability provided by Docker
Engine that enforces client-side signing and verification of Docker
image tags. It provides the ability to use digital signatures for data
sent to and received from Docker Trusted Registry and the public
Docker Store. These signatures allow client-side verification of the
integrity and publisher of specific image tags. When enabling Docker
Content Trust in Docker Enterprise Edition you can enforce the use of
signed Docker images. Additional information can be found at the
following resources:
