The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) is federal law that
requires the U.S. Federal government to adhere to stringent information security
requirements for all information systems that it operates. FISMA is implemented
through a combination of publications and guidance documents developed by the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), mandatory Federal
Information Processing Standards (FIPS), memorandums and circulars published by
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and various other agencies and
regulatory authorities that are tasked with coordinating information
security-related initiatives.

To help satisfy FISMA requirements when Docker Enterprise Edition is included as
part of your information system, we've provided guidance that aligns to one of
the law's key documents, [NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-37](nist/800_37.md),
*Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information
Systems: a security Life Cycle Approach* ([link to external
publication](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-37/rev-1/final)).

We'll be updating this section with additional guidance for other FISMA-related
documents over time.
