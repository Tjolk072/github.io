The Center for Information Security (CIS) Docker Benchmark is a reference document that can be used by system administrators, security and audit professionals and other IT roles in order to establish a secure configuration baseline for the Docker Engine.

The latest benchmark for Docker CE 17.06 can be found [here](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/docker/). The open source [Docker Bench for Security](https://github.com/docker/docker-bench-security) toolkit can also be used to validate a running instance of Docker against the CIS Docker Benchmark.
