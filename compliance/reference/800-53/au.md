## AU-1 Audit And Accountability Policy And Procedures

#### Description

The organization:
<ol type="a">
<li>Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]:</li>

<ol type="1">
<li>An audit and accountability policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and</li>
<li>Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the audit and accountability policy and associated audit and accountability controls; and</li>
</ol>
<li>Reviews and updates the current:</li>

## AU-2 Audit Events

#### Description

The organization:
<ol type="a">
<li>Determines that the information system is capable of auditing the following events: [Assignment: organization-defined auditable events];</li>
<li>Coordinates the security audit function with other organizational entities requiring audit-related information to enhance mutual support and to help guide the selection of auditable events;</li>
<li>Provides a rationale for why the auditable events are deemed to be adequate to support after-the-fact investigations of security incidents; and</li>
<li>Determines that the following events are to be audited within the information system: [Assignment: organization-defined audited events (the subset of the auditable events defined in AU-2 a.) along with the frequency of (or situation requiring) auditing for each identified event].</li>

Docker Enterprise Edition includes functionality known as Docker
Content Trust which allows one to cryptographically sign Docker
images. It enforces client-side signing and verification of image tags
and provides the ability to use digital signatures for data sent to
and received from Docker Trusted Registry. This ultimately provides
one with the ability to verify both the integrity and the publisher of
all data received from DTR over any channel. With Docker Content
Trust, an organization can enforce signature verification of all
content and prohibit unsigned and unapproved content from being
manipulated; thus supproting the non-repudiation requirements of this
control. Additional information can be found at the following
