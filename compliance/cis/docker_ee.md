title: CIS Docker EE benchmark

In January 2018, in partnership with the Center for Internet Security (CIS) and
Microsoft, we began to collaborate on an updated version of the CIS Docker
Benchmark to incorporate Docker Enterprise Edition security recommendations.
This includes Docker EE Engine, Docker Trusted Registry (DTR), and Universal
Control Plane (UCP). These updates will also include configuration items for
Docker EE Engine on Windows Server, Windows Server host items, and Windows-based
Docker image recommendations. We anticipate completion of the draft and final
update of the Benchmark in 2018.

You can follow along and contribute to the development of this updated Benchmark
by joining the [CIS Docker Benchmarks
Community](https://workbench.cisecurity.org/communities/37) in CIS WorkBench.
The initial announcement of these updates can also be found in the Community
Discussions
[here](https://workbench.cisecurity.org/community/37/discussions/3349).

In the interim, you can reference the existing CIS Docker CE Benchmark
recommendations per our guidance [here](/compliance/cis/docker_ce.md) and refer
to our latest [Docker EE Security Reference
Architecture](http://success.docker.com/article/Docker_Reference_Architecture-_Securing_Docker_EE_and_Security_Best_Practices).
We will update this page accordingly once the new CIS Benchmark updates have
been completed.
