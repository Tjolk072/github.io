# Migration

This branch is the result of a migration of documentation from several public and
private repositories. Every attempt has been made to preserve the history of all
content which was migrated from public repositories, so that all public
contributors retain credit for their work, and so that `git log` and
`git blame` commands will work on historical files. At the time of the migration,
over 42,000 public commits already exist in these files, which shows what a
vibrant community the Docker documentation attracts. Thanks to everyone for their
contributions.

The following is a list of each public repository we imported from, the SHA
reference we imported, and its tag if relevant.
