title: Docker for Mac Edge release notes
---

Here are the main improvements and issues per edge release, starting with the
current release. The documentation is updated for each release.

For system requirements, see
[What to know before you install](install.md#what-to-know-before-you-install).

Release notes for _edge_ releases are listed below, [_stable_ release
notes](release-notes) are also available. (Following the CE release model,
'beta' releases are called 'edge' releases.) You can learn about both kinds of
releases, and download stable and edge product installers at [Download Docker
for Mac](install.md#download-docker-for-mac).

### Docker Community Edition 17.11.0-ce-mac40 2017-11-22

* Upgrades
  - [Docker 17.11.0-ce](https://github.com/docker/docker-ce/releases/tag/v17.11.0-ce)

### Docker Community Edition 17.11.0-ce-rc4-mac39 2017-11-17

* Bug fixes and minor changes
  - Fix login into private repository with certificate issue. [https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/2201](docker/for-mac#2201)

* New
  - For systems running APFS on SSD on High Sierra, use `raw` format VM disks by default. This increases disk throughput (from 320MiB/sec to 600MiB/sec in `dd` on a 2015 MacBook Pro) and disk space handling.
  Existing disks are kept in qcow format, if you want to switch to raw format you need to "Reset to factory defaults". To query the space usage of the file, use a command like:
  `$ cd ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/com.docker.driver.amd64-linux/`
  `$ ls -ls Docker.raw`
  `3944768 -rw-r--r--@ 1 user  staff  68719476736 Nov 16 11:19 Docker.raw`
  The first number (`3944768`) is the allocated space in blocks; the larger number `68719476736` is the maximum total amount of space the file may consume in future in bytes.

**Known issues**

* Docker.app sometimes uses 200% CPU after macOS wakes up from sleep mode. The issue is being investigated. The workaround is to restart Docker.app

* There are a number of issues with the performance of directories bind-mounted with `osxfs`. In particular, writes of small blocks and traversals of large directories are currently slow. Additionally, containers that perform large numbers of directory operations, such as repeated scans of large directory trees, may suffer from poor performance. More information is available in [Known Issues](troubleshoot.md#known-issues) in [Troubleshooting](troubleshoot.md)

* Under some unhandled error conditions, `inotify` event delivery can fail and become permanently disabled. The workaround is to restart Docker.app

### Beta 21.1 Release Notes (2016-08-03 1.12.0-beta21.1)

This bug fix release contains osxfs improvements. The fixed issues may have
been seen as failures with apt-get and npm in containers, missed `inotify`
events or unexpected unmounts.

**Hotfixes**

* osxfs: fixed an issue causing access to children of renamed directories to fail (symptoms: npm failures, apt-get failures) (docker/for-mac)

* osxfs: fixed an issue causing some ATTRIB and CREATE `inotify` events to fail delivery and other `inotify` events to stop

* osxfs: fixed an issue causing all `inotify` events to stop when an ancestor directory of a mounted directory was mounted

* osxfs: fixed an issue causing volumes mounted under other mounts to spontaneously unmount (docker/docker#24503)

### Docker for Mac 1.12.0 (2016-07-28 1.12.0-beta21)

**New**

* Docker for Mac is now available from 2 channels: **stable** and **beta**. New features and bug fixes will go out first in auto-updates to users in the beta channel. Updates to the stable channel are much less frequent and happen in sync with major and minor releases of the Docker engine. Only features that are well-tested and ready for production are added to the stable channel releases.
