---

To get started with Docker Engine - Community on Fedora, make sure you
[meet the prerequisites](#prerequisites), then
[install Docker](#install-docker-ce).

## Prerequisites


### OS requirements

To install Docker, you need the 64-bit version of one of these Fedora versions:

- 30
- 31

### Uninstall old versions

Older versions of Docker were called `docker` or `docker-engine`. If these are
installed, uninstall them, along with associated dependencies.

```bash
$ sudo dnf remove docker \
                  docker-client \
                  docker-client-latest \
                  docker-common \
                  docker-latest \
                  docker-latest-logrotate \
                  docker-logrotate \
                  docker-selinux \
                  docker-engine-selinux \
                  docker-engine
```

It's OK if `dnf` reports that none of these packages are installed.

The contents of `/var/lib/docker/`, including images, containers, volumes, and
networks, are preserved. The Docker Engine - Community package is now called `docker-ce`.

## Install Docker Engine - Community

You can install Docker Engine - Community in different ways, depending on your needs:

- Most users
  [set up Docker's repositories](#install-using-the-repository) and install
  from them, for ease of installation and upgrade tasks. This is the
  recommended approach.

- Some users download the RPM package and
  [install it manually](#install-from-a-package) and manage
  upgrades completely manually. This is useful in situations such as installing
  Docker on air-gapped systems with no access to the internet.

- In testing and development environments, some users choose to use automated
  [convenience scripts](#install-using-the-convenience-script) to install Docker.

### Install using the repository

Before you install Docker Engine - Community for the first time on a new host machine, you need
to set up the Docker repository. Afterward, you can install and update Docker
from the repository.

#### Set up the repository

{% assign download-url-base = "https://download.docker.com/linux/fedora" %}

1.  Install the `dnf-plugins-core` package which provides the commands to manage
    your DNF repositories from the command line.

    ```bash
    $ sudo dnf -y install dnf-plugins-core
    ```

2.  Use the following command to set up the **stable** repository.

    ```bash
    $ sudo dnf config-manager \
        --add-repo \
        {{ download-url-base }}/docker-ce.repo
    ```

> **Optional**: Enable the **nightly** or **test** repositories.
>
> These repositories are included in the `docker.repo` file above but are disabled
> by default. You can enable them alongside the stable repository.  The following
> command enables the **nightly** repository.
>
> ```bash
> $ sudo dnf config-manager --set-enabled docker-ce-nightly
> ```
>
> To enable the **test** channel, run the following command:
>
> ```bash
> $ sudo dnf config-manager --set-enabled docker-ce-test
> ```
>
> You can disable the **nightly** or **test** repository by running the
> `dnf config-manager` command with the `--set-disabled` flag. To re-enable it,
> use the `--set-enabled` flag. The following command disables the **nightly**
> repository.
>
> ```bash
> $ sudo dnf config-manager --set-disabled docker-ce-nightly
> ```
>
> [Learn about **nightly** and **test** channels](/install/index.md).

#### Install Docker Engine - Community

1.  Install the _latest version_ of Docker Engine - Community and containerd, or go to the next step to install a specific version:

    ```bash
    $ sudo dnf install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
    ```

    If prompted to accept the GPG key, verify that the fingerprint matches
    `060A 61C5 1B55 8A7F 742B 77AA C52F EB6B 621E 9F35`, and if so, accept it.

    > Got multiple Docker repositories?
    >
    > If you have multiple Docker repositories enabled, installing
    > or updating without specifying a version in the `dnf install` or
    > `dnf update` command always installs the highest possible version,
    > which may not be appropriate for your stability needs.

    Docker is installed but not started. The `docker` group is created, but no users are added to the group.

2.  To install a _specific version_ of Docker Engine - Community, list the available versions
    in the repo, then select and install:

    a. List and sort the versions available in your repo. This example sorts
       results by version number, highest to lowest, and is truncated:

    ```bash
    $ dnf list docker-ce  --showduplicates | sort -r

    docker-ce.x86_64  3:18.09.1-3.fc28                 docker-ce-stable
    docker-ce.x86_64  3:18.09.0-3.fc28                 docker-ce-stable
    docker-ce.x86_64  18.06.1.ce-3.fc28                docker-ce-stable
    docker-ce.x86_64  18.06.0.ce-3.fc28                docker-ce-stable
    ```

    The list returned depends on which repositories are enabled, and is specific
    to your version of Fedora (indicated by the `.fc28` suffix in this example).

    b. Install a specific version by its fully qualified package name, which is
       the package name (`docker-ce`) plus the version string (2nd column) up to
       the first hyphen, separated by a hyphen (`-`), for example,
       `docker-ce-3:18.09.1`.

    ```bash
    $ sudo dnf -y install docker-ce-<VERSION_STRING> docker-ce-cli-<VERSION_STRING> containerd.io
    ```

    Docker is installed but not started. The `docker` group is created, but no users are added to the group.

3.  Cgroups Exception
    For Fedora 31, you'll have to enable the [backwards compatibility for Cgroups](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Common_F31_bugs#Other_software_issues).

    ```bash
    $ sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args="systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=0"
    ```

4.  Start Docker

    ```bash
    $ sudo systemctl start docker
    ```

5.  Verify that Docker Engine - Community is installed correctly by running the `hello-world`
    image.

    ```bash
    $ sudo docker run hello-world
    ```

    This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. When the
    container runs, it prints an informational message and exits.

Docker Engine - Community is installed and running. You need to use `sudo` to run Docker
commands. Continue to [Linux postinstall](/install/linux/linux-postinstall.md) to allow
non-privileged users to run Docker commands and for other optional configuration
steps.

#### Upgrade Docker Engine - Community

To upgrade Docker Engine - Community, follow the [installation instructions](#install-docker-ce),
choosing the new version you want to install.

### Install from a package

If you cannot use Docker's repository to install Docker, you can download the
`.rpm` file for your release and install it manually. You need to download
a new file each time you want to upgrade Docker Engine - Community.

1.  Go to [{{ download-url-base }}/]({{ download-url-base }}/) and choose your
    version of Fedora. Go to `x86_64/stable/Packages/`
    and download the `.rpm` file for the Docker version you want to install.

    > **Note**: To install a **nightly**  or **test** (pre-release) package,
    > change the word `stable` in the above URL to `nightly` or `test`.
    > [Learn about **nightly** and **test** channels](/install/index.md).

2.  Install Docker Engine - Community, changing the path below to the path where you downloaded
    the Docker package.

    ```bash
    $ sudo dnf -y install /path/to/package.rpm
    ```

3.  Start Docker.

    ```bash
    $ sudo systemctl start docker
    ```

4.  Verify that Docker Engine - Community is installed correctly by running the `hello-world`
    image.

    ```bash
    $ sudo docker run hello-world
    ```

    This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. When the
    container runs, it prints an informational message and exits.

Docker Engine - Community is installed and running. You need to use `sudo` to run Docker commands.
Continue to [Post-installation steps for Linux](/install/linux/linux-postinstall.md) to allow
non-privileged users to run Docker commands and for other optional configuration
steps.

#### Upgrade Docker Engine - Community

To upgrade Docker Engine - Community, download the newer package file and repeat the
[installation procedure](#install-from-a-package), using `dnf -y upgrade`
instead of `dnf -y install`, and pointing to the new file.

{% include install-script.md %}

## Uninstall Docker Engine - Community

1.  Uninstall the Docker package:

    ```bash
    $ sudo dnf remove docker-ce
    ```

2.  Images, containers, volumes, or customized configuration files on your host
    are not automatically removed. To delete all images, containers, and
    volumes:

    ```bash
    $ sudo rm -rf /var/lib/docker
    ```

You must delete any edited configuration files manually.
