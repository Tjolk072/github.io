Docker is available in two editions:
* Community Edition (CE)
* Enterprise Edition (EE)

Docker Community Edition (CE) is ideal for individual developers and small teams
looking to get started with Docker and experimenting with container-based apps.

Docker Enterprise Edition (EE) is designed for enterprise development and IT
teams who build, ship, and run business critical applications in production at
scale.
