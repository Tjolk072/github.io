Install Docker Trusted Registry

## Usage

```bash
docker run -it --rm docker/dtr \
    install [command options]
```

## Description


This command installs Docker Trusted Registry (DTR) on a node managed by
Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP).

After installing DTR, you can join additional DTR replicas using `docker/dtr join`.

## Example Usage

```bash
$ docker run -it --rm docker/dtr:{{ site.dtr_version }}.0 install \
	--ucp-node <UCP_NODE_HOSTNAME> \
	--ucp-insecure-tls
```

> **Note**: Use `--ucp-ca "$(cat ca.pem)"` instead of `--ucp-insecure-tls` for a production deployment.

## Options

| Option                        | Environment Variable      | Description                                                                          |
|:------------------------------|:--------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--async-nfs` | $ASYNC_NFS | Use async NFS volume options on the replica specified in the `--existing-replica-id` option. The NFS configuration must be set with `--nfs-storage-url` explicitly to use this option. Using `--async-nfs` will bring down any containers on the replica that use the NFS volume, delete the NFS volume, bring it back up with the appropriate configuration, and restart any containers that were brought down.  |
| `--client-cert-auth-ca ` | $CLIENT_CA | Specify root CA certificates for client authentication with `--client-cert-auth-ca "$(cat ca.pem)"`. |
| `--debug` | $DEBUG | Enable debug mode for additional logs. |
| `--dtr-ca` | $DTR_CA | Use a PEM-encoded TLS CA certificate for DTR. By default DTR generates a self-signed TLS certificate during deployment. You can use your own root CA public certificate with `--dtr-ca "$(cat ca.pem)"`. |
| `--dtr-cert` | $DTR_CERT | Use a PEM-encoded TLS certificate for DTR. By default DTR generates a self-signed TLS certificate during deployment. You can use your own public key certificate with `--dtr-cert "$(cat cert.pem)"`. If the certificate has been signed by an intermediate certificate authority, append its public key certificate at the end of the file to establish a chain of trust. |
| `--dtr-external-url` | $DTR_EXTERNAL_URL | URL of the host or load balancer clients use to reach DTR. When you use this flag, users are redirected to UCP for logging in. Once authenticated  they are redirected to the URL you specify in this flag. If you don't use this flag, DTR  is deployed without single sign-on with UCP. Users and teams are shared but users log in  separately into the two applications. You can enable and disable single sign-on within your DTR system settings. Format `https://host[:port]`, where port is the value you used  with `--replica-https-port`. Since [HSTS (HTTP Strict-Transport-Security) header](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security) is included in all API responses, make sure to specify the FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) of your DTR, or your browser may refuse to load the web interface. |
| `--dtr-key` | $DTR_KEY | Use a PEM-encoded TLS private key for DTR. By default DTR generates a self-signed TLS certificate during deployment. You can use your own TLS private key with `--dtr-key "$(cat key.pem)"`. |
| `--dtr-storage-volume` | $DTR_STORAGE_VOLUME | Customize the volume to store Docker images. By default DTR creates a volume to store the Docker images in the local filesystem of the node where DTR is running, without high-availability. Use this flag to  specify a full path or volume name for DTR to store images. For high-availability, make  sure all DTR replicas can read and write data on this volume. If you're using NFS, use  `--nfs-storage-url` instead. |
| `--enable-client-cert-auth` | $ENABLE_CLIENT_CERT_AUTH |  Enables TLS client certificate authentication; use `--enable-client-cert-auth=false` to disable it. If enabled, DTR will additionally authenticate users via TLS client certificates. You must also specify the root certificate authorities (CAs) that issued the certificates with `--client-cert-auth-ca`. |
| `--enable-pprof` | $DTR_PPROF | Enables pprof profiling of the server. Use `--enable-pprof=false` to disable it. Once DTR is deployed with this flag, you can access the `pprof` endpoint for the api server  at `/debug/pprof`, and the registry endpoint at `/registry_debug_pprof/debug/pprof`. |
| `--help-extended` | $DTR_EXTENDED_HELP | Display extended help text for a given command. |
| `--http-proxy` | $DTR_HTTP_PROXY | The HTTP proxy used for outgoing requests. |
| `--https-proxy` | $DTR_HTTPS_PROXY | The HTTPS proxy used for outgoing requests. |
| `--log-host` | $LOG_HOST | The syslog system to send logs to.The endpoint to send logs to. Use this flag if you set `--log-protocol` to `tcp` or `udp`. |
| `--log-level` | $LOG_LEVEL | Log level for all container logs when logging to syslog. Default: INFO. The supported log levels are debug, info, warn, error, or fatal. |
| `--log-protocol` | $LOG_PROTOCOL | The protocol for sending logs. Default is internal. By default, DTR internal components log information using the logger specified in the Docker daemon in the node where the DTR replica is deployed. Use this option to send DTR logs to an external syslog system. The supported values are `tcp`, `udp`, or `internal`. Internal is the default option, stopping DTR from sending logs to an external system.   Use this flag with `--log-host`. |
| `--nfs-storage-url` | $NFS_STORAGE_URL | Use NFS to store Docker images following this format: `nfs://<ip|hostname>/<mountpoint>`. By default, DTR creates a volume to store the Docker images in the local filesystem  of the node where DTR is running, without high availability. To  use this flag, you need to install an NFS client library like ***nfs-common*** in the node  where you're deploying DTR. You can test this by running `showmount -e <nfs-server>`. When  you join new replicas, they will start using NFS so there is no need to specify this flag. To  reconfigure DTR to stop using NFS, leave this option empty: `--nfs-storage-url ""`. See [USE NFS](/ee/dtr/admin/configure/external-storage/nfs/) for more details. |
| `--nfs-options` | $NFS_OPTIONS | Pass in NFS volume options verbatim for the replica specified in the `--existing-replica-id` option. The NFS configuration must be set with `--nfs-storage-url` explicitly to use this option. Specifying `--nfs-options` will pass in character-for-character the options specified in the argument when creating or recreating the NFS volume. For instance, to use NFS v4 with async, pass in "rw,nfsvers=4,async" as the argument.  |
| `--no-proxy` | $DTR_NO_PROXY | List of domains the proxy should not be used for. When using `--http-proxy` you can use this flag to specify a list  of domains that you don't want to route through the proxy. Format `acme.com[, acme.org]`. |
| `--overlay-subnet` | $DTR_OVERLAY_SUBNET | The subnet used by the dtr-ol overlay network. Example: `10.0.0.0/24`. For high-availability, DTR creates an overlay network between UCP nodes. This flag allows you to choose the subnet for that network. Make sure the subnet you choose is not used on any machine where DTR replicas are deployed. |
| `--replica-http-port` | $REPLICA_HTTP_PORT | The public HTTP port for the DTR replica. Default is `80`. This allows you to customize the HTTP port where users can reach DTR. Once users access  the HTTP port, they are redirected to use an HTTPS connection, using the port specified  with `--replica-https-port`. This port can also be used for unencrypted health checks. |
| `--replica-https-port` | $REPLICA_HTTPS_PORT | The public HTTPS port for the DTR replica. Default is `443`. This allows you to customize the HTTPS port where users can reach DTR. Each replica can  use a different port. |
| `--replica-id` | $DTR_INSTALL_REPLICA_ID | Assign a 12-character hexadecimal ID to the DTR replica. Random by default. |
| `--replica-rethinkdb-cache-mb` | $RETHINKDB_CACHE_MB | The maximum amount of space in MB for RethinkDB in-memory cache used by the given replica. Default is auto. Auto is `(available_memory - 1024) / 2`. This config allows changing the RethinkDB cache usage per replica. You need to run it once per replica to change each one. |
| `--ucp-ca` | $UCP_CA | Use a PEM-encoded TLS CA certificate for UCP. Download the UCP TLS CA certificate from `https://<ucp-url>/ca`, and  use `--ucp-ca "$(cat ca.pem)"`. |
| `--ucp-insecure-tls` | $UCP_INSECURE_TLS | Disable TLS verification for UCP. The installation uses TLS but always trusts the TLS certificate used by UCP, which can lead to MITM (man-in-the-middle) attacks.  For production deployments, use `--ucp-ca "$(cat ca.pem)"` instead. |
| `--ucp-node` | $UCP_NODE | The hostname of the UCP node to deploy DTR. Random by default. You can find the hostnames of the nodes in the cluster in the UCP web interface, or  by running `docker node ls` on a UCP manager node. |
| `--ucp-password` | $UCP_PASSWORD | The UCP administrator password. |
| `--ucp-url` | $UCP_URL | The UCP URL including domain and port. |
| `--ucp-username` | $UCP_USERNAME | The UCP administrator username. |
