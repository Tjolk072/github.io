Anyone interested in Docker can become an active member of the Docker community
by becoming co-organizer of a Docker Meetup group.

If a Meetup group does not already exist in your area and you are willing to
start a new one, the best way to proceed is to contact us so that we can create
it for you. We will always agree to create a new Docker Meetup group as long as
it makes sense geographically speaking.

If you have already created a Docker Meetup group that is fine, we will simply
ask you to add us as a co-organizer so that we can ensure a consistent support
to the group in terms of community and Meetup management.

Before contacting us to create a new Docker Meetup Group, take a look at our
Meetup Groups page to make sure a group does not already exist in the area.

## Get started putting on a Docker Meetup

Now that you are co-organizer of a Docker Meetup Group, here are a few tips and
suggestions to help you get started:

* Attend similar DevOps or Developers Meetups to gain experience and gauge interest in Docker
* Contact other people interested in Docker to help you organize and promote future Meetups
* Research High-Tech companies in your area willing to host a Docker Meetup event
* Research what would be the best date(s) to schedule the Meetups based on availabilities with regard to competing events in the area and other calendar imperative
* Research what are the topic of interest to your audience prior to set an agenda for the meetup
* Pay attention to the Meetup page aesthetics, add logos and pictures, invite members to leave comments and reply to these comments
* Promote the event on social media and make sure that the list of keywords is well define if you have created the Docker Meetup Group on your own

## How Docker can help you organize

We can support the co-organizers of the Docker Meetup Groups based on their specific needs. For instance, we might / will be able to:

* Send you Docker T-shirts and stickers
* Put you in contact with other people interested in being a co-organizer of a Docker Meetup group, and which are in the same area
* Put you in contact with companies willing to host a Docker Meetup in your area
* Introduce you to people willing to give a lightning talk about Docker
Promote your Docker Group on Docker.com, Docker Weekly and Social Media

## Want to host a Docker Meetup?

We are always looking for new office space to host Docker Meetups. If your
company is willing to host a Docker Meetup, please contact us by email at
meetup@docker.com. Previous Docker Meetups have been hosted by companies such
as Rackspace, Twitter, MongoDB, BrightCove, DigitalOcean, Viadeo and Edmodo

### How many attendees?

The company hosting the event fixes the number of attendees depending on their
office size and availability. This number usually varies between 30 and 200.

### How long is a Docker Meetup?

Once again, each company hosting the event decides when does the meetup start,
and how long it lasts. Usual meetups tend to last 2 hours, and start between
4pm and 6pm.
