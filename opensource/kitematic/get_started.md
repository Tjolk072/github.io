Kitematic is an open source project that simplifies the Docker experience. It
automates Docker installation and setup, and provides an interactive graphical
user interface (GUI) for working with containers. You can use Kitematic to create, run, and manage Docker containers, and find public images on Docker Hub.

## We welcome your contributions!

We'd like to see Kitematic evolve
with community contributed add-ons, extensions, themes, plug-ins, and cool, new
features.
