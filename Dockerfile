# This Dockerfile builds the docs for https://docs.docker.com/
# from the master branch of https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io
#
# Here is the sequence:
# 1.  Set up base stages for building and deploying
# 2.  Collect and build the archived documentation
# 3.  Collect and build the reference documentation (from upstream resources)
# 4.  Build static HTML from the current branch
# 5.  Build the final image, combining the archives, reference docs, and
#     current version of the documentation
#
# When the image is run, it starts Nginx and serves the docs at port 4000
