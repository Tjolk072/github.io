This tutorial explains how to deploy a NGINX web server and limit access to one
team with role-based access control (RBAC).

## Scenario

You are the Docker EE system administrator at Acme Company and need to configure
permissions to company resources. The best way to do this is to:

- Build the organization with teams and users.
- Define roles with allowable operations per resource types, like
  permission to run containers.
- Create collections or namespaces for accessing actual resources.
- Create grants that join team + role + resource set.

## Build the organization

Add the organization, `acme-datacenter`, and create three teams according to the
following structure:

```
acme-datacenter
├── dba
│ └── Alex*
├── dev
│ └── Bett
└── ops
├── Alex*
└── Chad
```

Learn to [create and configure users and teams](create-users-and-teams-manually.md).

## Kubernetes deployment

In this section, we deploy NGINX with Kubernetes. See [Swarm stack](#swarm-stack)
for the same exercise with Swarm.

### Create namespace

Create a namespace to logically store the NGINX application:

1. Click **Kubernetes** > **Namespaces**.
2. Paste the following manifest in the terminal window and click **Create**.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: nginx-namespace
```

### Create a team

Learn to [create and configure users and teams](create-users-and-teams-manually.md).

### Define roles

For this exercise, create a simple role for the ops team. To learn how to create roles for Kubernetes,
see [Configure native Kubernetes role-based access control](/ee/ucp/admin/configure/configure-rbac-kube/).

### Grant access

Grant the ops team (and only the ops team) access to nginx-namespace with the
custom role, **Kube Deploy**.

```
acme-datacenter/ops + Kube Deploy + nginx-namespace
```

### Deploy NGINX

You've configured Docker EE. The `ops` team can now deploy `nginx`.

1. Log on to UCP as "chad" (on the `ops`team).
2. Click **Kubernetes** > **Namespaces**.
3. Paste the following manifest in the terminal window and click **Create**.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1beta2  # Use apps/v1beta1 for versions < 1.8.0
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  replicas: 2
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

4. Log on to UCP as each user and ensure that:
- `dba` (alex) can't see `nginx-namespace`.
- `dev` (bett) can't see `nginx-namespace`.

## Swarm stack

In this section, we deploy `nginx` as a Swarm service. See [Kubernetes Deployment](#kubernetes-deployment)
for the same exercise with Kubernetes.

### Create collection paths

Create a collection for NGINX resources, nested under the `/Shared` collection:

```
/
├── System
└── Shared
    └── nginx-collection
```

> **Tip**: To drill into a collection, click **View Children**.

Learn to [group and isolate cluster resources](group-resources.md).

### Define roles

You can use the built-in roles or define your own. For this exercise, create a
simple role for the ops team:

1. Click **Roles** under **User Management**.
2. Click **Create Role**.
3. On the **Details** tab, name the role `Swarm Deploy`.
4. On the **Operations** tab, check all **Service Operations**.
5. Click **Create**.

Learn to [create and configure users and teams](define-roles.md).

### Grant access

Grant the ops team (and only the ops team) access to `nginx-collection` with
the built-in role, **Swarm Deploy**.

```
acme-datacenter/ops + Swarm Deploy + /Shared/nginx-collection
```

Learn to [grant role-access to cluster resources](grant-permissions.md).

### Deploy NGINX

You've configured Docker EE. The `ops` team can now deploy an `nginx` Swarm
service.

1. Log on to UCP as chad (on the `ops`team).
2. Click **Swarm** > **Services**.
3. Click **Create Stack**.
4. On the Details tab, enter:
   - Name: `nginx-service`
   - Image: nginx:latest
5. On the Collections tab:
   - Click `/Shared` in the breadcrumbs.
   - Select `nginx-collection`.
6. Click **Create**.
7. Log on to UCP as each user and ensure that:
   - `dba` (alex) cannot see `nginx-collection`.
   - `dev` (bett) cannot see `nginx-collection`.
