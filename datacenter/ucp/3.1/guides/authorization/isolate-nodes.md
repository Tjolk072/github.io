With Docker EE Advanced, you can enable physical isolation of resources
by organizing nodes into collections and granting `Scheduler` access for
different users. To control access to nodes, move them to dedicated collections
where you can grant access to specific users, teams, and organizations.

![](../images/containers-and-nodes-diagram.svg)

In this example, a team gets access to a node collection and a resource
collection, and UCP access control ensures that the team members can't view
or use swarm resources that aren't in their collection.

You need a Docker EE Advanced license and at least two worker nodes to
complete this example.

1.  Create an `Ops` team and assign a user to it.
2.  Create a `/Prod` collection for the team's node.
3.  Assign a worker node to the `/Prod` collection.
4.  Grant the `Ops` teams access to its collection.

## Create a team

In the web UI, navigate to the **Organizations & Teams** page to create a team
named "Ops" in your organization. Add a user who isn't a UCP administrator to
the team.
[Learn to create and manage teams](create-users-and-teams-manually.md).

## Create a node collection and a resource collection

In this example, the Ops team uses an assigned group of nodes, which it
accesses through a collection. Also, the team has a separate collection
for its resources.

Create two collections: one for the team's worker nodes and another for the
team's resources.

1.  Navigate to the **Collections** page to view all of the resource
    collections in the swarm.
2.  Click **Create collection** and name the new collection "Prod".
3.  Click **Create** to create the collection.
4.  Find **Prod** in the list, and click **View children**.
5.  Click **Create collection**, and name the child collection
    "Webserver". This creates a sub-collection for access control.

You've created two new collections. The `/Prod` collection is for the worker
nodes, and the `/Prod/Webserver` sub-collection is for access control to
an application that you'll deploy on the corresponding worker nodes.

## Move a worker node to a collection

By default, worker nodes are located in the `/Shared` collection.
Worker nodes that are running DTR are assigned to the `/System` collection.
To control access to the team's nodes, move them to a dedicated collection.

Move a worker node by changing the value of its access label key,
`com.docker.ucp.access.label`, to a different collection.

1.  Navigate to the **Nodes** page to view all of the nodes in the swarm.
2.  Click a worker node, and in the details pane, find its **Collection**.
    If it's in the `/System` collection, click another worker node,
    because you can't move nodes that are in the `/System` collection. By
    default, worker nodes are assigned to the `/Shared` collection.
3.  When you've found an available node, in the details pane, click
    **Configure**.
3.  In the **Labels** section, find `com.docker.ucp.access.label` and change
    its value from `/Shared` to `/Prod`.
4.  Click **Save** to move the node to the `/Prod` collection.

> Docker EE Advanced required
>
> If you don't have a Docker EE Advanced license, you'll get the following
> error message when you try to change the access label:
> **Nodes must be in either the shared or system collection without an advanced license.**

## Grant access for a team

You need two grants to control access to nodes and container resources:

-  Grant the `Ops` team the `Restricted Control` role for the `/Prod/Webserver`
   resources.
-  Grant the `Ops` team the `Scheduler` role against the nodes in the `/Prod`
   collection.

Create two grants for team access to the two collections:

1.  Navigate to the **Grants** page and click **Create Grant**.
2.  In the left pane, click **Resource Sets**, and in the **Swarm** collection,
    click **View Children**.
3.  In the **Prod** collection, click **View Children**.
4.  In the **Webserver** collection, click **Select Collection**.
5.  In the left pane, click **Roles**, and select **Restricted Control**
    in the dropdown.
6.  Click **Subjects**, and under **Select subject type**, click **Organizations**.
7.  Select your organization, and in the **Team** dropdown, select **Ops**.
8.  Click **Create** to grant the Ops team access to the `/Prod/Webserver`
    collection.

The same steps apply for the nodes in the `/Prod` collection.

1.  Navigate to the **Grants** page and click **Create Grant**.
2.  In the left pane, click **Collections**, and in the **Swarm** collection,
    click **View Children**.
3.  In the **Prod** collection, click **Select Collection**.
4.  In the left pane, click **Roles**, and in the dropdown, select **Scheduler**.
5.  In the left pane, click **Subjects**, and under **Select subject type**, click
    **Organizations**.
6.  Select your organization, and in the **Team** dropdown, select **Ops** .
7.  Click **Create** to grant the Ops team `Scheduler` access to the nodes in the
    `/Prod` collection.

![](../images/isolate-nodes-2.png){: .with-border}

The cluster is set up for node isolation. Users with access to nodes in the
`/Prod` collection can deploy [Swarm services](#deploy-a-swarm-service-as-a-team-member)
and [Kubernetes apps](#deploy-a-kubernetes-application), and their workloads
won't be scheduled on nodes that aren't in the collection.

## Deploy a Swarm service as a team member

When a user deploys a Swarm service, UCP assigns its resources to the user's
default collection.

From the target collection of a resource, UCP walks up the ancestor collections
until it finds the highest ancestor that the user has `Scheduler` access to.
Tasks are scheduled on any nodes in the tree below this ancestor. In this example,
UCP assigns the user's service to the `/Prod/Webserver` collection and schedules
tasks on nodes in the `/Prod` collection.

As a user on the `Ops` team, set your default collection to `/Prod/Webserver`.

1.  Log in as a user on the `Ops` team.
2.  Navigate to the **Collections** page, and in the **Prod** collection,
    click **View Children**.
3.  In the **Webserver** collection, click the **More Options** icon and
    select **Set to default**.

Deploy a service automatically to worker nodes in the `/Prod` collection.
All resources are deployed under the user's default collection,
`/Prod/Webserver`, and the containers are scheduled only on the nodes under
`/Prod`.

1.  Navigate to the **Services** page, and click **Create Service**.
2.  Name the service "NGINX", use the "nginx:latest" image, and click
    **Create**.
3.  When the **nginx** service status is green, click the service. In the
    details view, click **Inspect Resource**, and in the dropdown, select
    **Containers**.
4.  Click the **NGINX** container, and in the details pane, confirm that its
    **Collection** is **/Prod/Webserver**.

5.  Click **Inspect Resource**, and in the dropdown, select **Nodes**.
6.  Click the node, and in the details pane, confirm that its **Collection**
    is **/Prod**.

### Alternative: Use a grant instead of the default collection

Another approach is to use a grant instead of changing the user's default
collection. An administrator can create a grant for a role that has the
`Service Create` permission against the `/Prod/Webserver` collection or a child
collection. In this case, the user sets the value of the service's access label,
`com.docker.ucp.access.label`, to the new collection or one of its children
that has a `Service Create` grant for the user.

## Deploy a Kubernetes application

Starting in Docker Enterprise Edition 2.0, you can deploy a Kubernetes workload
to worker nodes, based on a Kubernetes namespace.

1.  Convert a node to use the Kubernetes orchestrator.
2.  Create a Kubernetes namespace.
3.  Create a grant for the namespace.
4.  Link the namespace to a node collection.
5.  Deploy a Kubernetes workload.

### Convert a node to Kubernetes

To deploy Kubernetes workloads, an administrator must convert a worker node to
use the Kubernetes orchestrator.
[Learn how to set the orchestrator type](../admin/configure/set-orchestrator-type.md)
for your nodes in the `/Prod` collection.

### Create a Kubernetes namespace

An administrator must create a Kubernetes namespace to enable node isolation
for Kubernetes workloads.

1.  In the left pane, click **Kubernetes**.
2.  Click **Create** to open the **Create Kubernetes Object** page.
3.  In the **Object YAML** editor, paste the following YAML.  

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Namespace
    metadata:
      Name: ops-nodes
    ```
4.  Click **Create** to create the `ops-nodes` namespace.

### Grant access to the Kubernetes namespace

Create a grant to the `ops-nodes` namespace for the `Ops` team by following the
same steps that you used to grant access to the `/Prod` collection, only this
time, on the **Create Grant** page, pick **Namespaces**, instead of
**Collections**.

![](../images/isolate-nodes-5.png){: .with-border}

Select the **ops-nodes** namespace, and create a `Full Control` grant for the
`Ops` team.

![](../images/isolate-nodes-6.png){: .with-border}

### Link the namespace to a node collection

The last step is to link the Kubernetes namespace the `/Prod` collection.

1.  Navigate to the **Namespaces** page, and find the **ops-nodes** namespace
    in the list.
2.  Click the **More options** icon and select **Link nodes in collection**.

    ![](../images/isolate-nodes-7.png){: .with-border}

3.  In the **Choose collection** section, click **View children** on the
    **Swarm** collection to navigate to the **Prod** collection.
4.  On the **Prod** collection, click **Select collection**.
5.  Click **Confirm** to link the namespace to the collection.

    ![](../images/isolate-nodes-8.png){: .with-border}

### Deploy a Kubernetes workload to the node collection

1.  Log in in as a non-admin who's on the `Ops` team.
2.  In the left pane, open the **Kubernetes** section.
3.  Confirm that **ops-nodes** is displayed under **Namespaces**.
4.  Click **Create**, and in the **Object YAML** editor, paste the following
    YAML definition for an NGINX server.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ReplicationController
    metadata:
      name: nginx
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      selector:
        app: nginx
      template:
        metadata:
          name: nginx
          labels:
            app: nginx
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: nginx
            image: nginx
            ports:
            - containerPort: 80
    ```

    ![](../images/isolate-nodes-9.png){: .with-border}

5.  Click **Create** to deploy the workload.
6.  In the left pane, click **Pods** and confirm that the workload is running
    on pods in the `ops-nodes` namespace.
