Universal Control Plane is a containerized application that runs on
[Docker Enterprise Edition](/ee/index.md), extending its functionality
to simplify the deployment, configuration, and monitoring of your applications at scale.

UCP also secures Docker with role-based access control so that only authorized
users can make changes and deploy applications to your Docker cluster.

Once Universal Control Plane (UCP) instance is deployed, developers and IT
operations no longer interact with Docker Engine directly, but interact with
UCP instead. Since UCP exposes the standard Docker API, this is all done
transparently, so that you can use the tools you already know and love, like
the Docker CLI client and Docker Compose.


## Under the hood

Docker UCP leverages the clustering and orchestration functionality provided
by Docker.

![](images/ucp-architecture-2.svg){: .with-border}

A swarm is a collection of nodes that are in the same Docker cluster.
[Nodes](/engine/swarm/key-concepts.md) in a Docker swarm operate in one of two
modes: Manager or Worker. If nodes are not already running in a swarm when
installing UCP, nodes will be configured to run in swarm mode.

When you deploy UCP, it starts running a globally scheduled service called
`ucp-agent`. This service monitors the node where it's running and starts
and stops UCP services, based on whether the node is a
[manager or a worker node](/engine/swarm/key-concepts.md).

If the node is a:

* **Manager**: the `ucp-agent` service automatically starts serving all UCP
  components, including the UCP web UI and data stores used by UCP. The
  `ucp-agent` accomplishes this by
  [deploying several containers](#ucp-components-in-manager-nodes)
  on the node. By promoting a node to manager, UCP automatically becomes
  highly available and fault tolerant.
* **Worker**: on worker nodes, the `ucp-agent` service starts serving a proxy
  service that ensures only authorized users and other UCP services can run
  Docker commands in that node. The `ucp-agent` deploys a
  [subset of containers](#ucp-components-in-worker-nodes) on worker nodes.

## UCP internal components

The core component of UCP is a globally-scheduled service called `ucp-agent`.
When you install UCP on a node, or join a node to a swarm that's being managed
by UCP, the `ucp-agent` service starts running on that node.

Once this service is running, it deploys containers with other UCP components,
and it ensures they keep running. The UCP components that are deployed
on a node depend on whether the node is a manager or a worker.

> OS-specific component names
>
> Some UCP component names depend on the node's operating system. For example,
> on Windows, the `ucp-agent` component is named `ucp-agent-win`.

Internally, UCP uses the following components:

* Calico v3.5.3
* Kubernetes v1.11.9

### UCP components in manager nodes

Manager nodes run all UCP services, including the web UI and data stores that
persist the state of UCP. These are the UCP services running on manager nodes:

## Pause containers

Every pod in Kubernetes has a _pause_ container, which is an "empty" container
that bootstraps the pod to establish all of the namespaces. Pause containers
hold the cgroups, reservations, and namespaces of a pod before its individual
containers are created. The pause container's image is always present, so the
allocation of the pod's resources is instantaneous.

By default, pause containers are hidden, but you can see them by running
`docker ps -a`.

```
docker ps -a | grep -I pause

## Volumes used by UCP

Docker UCP uses these named volumes to persist data in all nodes where it runs:

| Volume name                 | Description                                                                              |
|:----------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ucp-auth-api-certs          | Certificate and keys for the authentication and authorization service                    |

| ucp-auth-worker-certs       | Certificate and keys for authentication worker                                           |
| ucp-auth-worker-data        | Data of the authentication worker                                                        |
| ucp-client-root-ca          | Root key material for the UCP root CA that issues client certificates                    |

| ucp-controller-client-certs | Certificate and keys used by the UCP web server to communicate with other UCP components |
| ucp-controller-server-certs | Certificate and keys for the UCP web server running in the node                          |
| ucp-kv                      | UCP configuration data, replicated across managers                                       |
| ucp-kv-certs                | Certificates and keys for the key-value store                                            |

You can customize the volume driver used for these volumes, by creating
the volumes before installing UCP. During the installation, UCP checks which
volumes don't exist in the node, and creates them using the default volume
driver.

By default, the data for these volumes can be found at
`/var/lib/docker/volumes/<volume-name>/_data`.

## Configurations used by UCP

| Configuration name             | Description                                                                                      |
|:-------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| com.docker.interlock.proxy     | Configuration for the service responsible for handling user requests and routing them            |
| com.docker.license             | The Docker EE license                                                                            |
| com.docker.ucp.interlock.conf  | Configuration for the core Interlock service                                                     |

## How you interact with UCP

There are two ways to interact with UCP: the web UI or the CLI.

You can use the UCP web UI to manage your swarm, grant and revoke user
permissions, deploy, configure, manage, and monitor your applications.

![](images/ucp-architecture-3.svg){: .with-border}

UCP also exposes the standard Docker API, so you can continue using existing
tools like the Docker CLI client. Since UCP secures your cluster with role-based
access control, you need to configure your Docker CLI client and other client
tools to authenticate your requests using
[client certificates](user-access/index.md) that you can download
from your UCP profile page.
