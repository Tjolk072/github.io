page, and click the **Routing Mesh** option. Check the **Enable routing mesh** option.

By default, the routing mesh service listens on port 80 for HTTP and port
8443 for HTTPS. Change the ports if you already have services that are using
them.

Once you save, the layer 7 routing service can be used by your swarm services.
