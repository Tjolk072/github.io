## Overview

Docker Assemble (`docker assemble`) is a plugin which provides a language and framework-aware tool that enables users to build an application into an optimized Docker container. With Docker Assemble, users can quickly build Docker images without providing configuration information (like Dockerfile) by auto-detecting the required information from existing framework configuration.

Docker Assemble supports the following application frameworks:

- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) when using the [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) build system

- [ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core) (with C# and F#)

## System requirements

Docker Assemble requires a Linux, Windows, or a macOS Mojave with the Docker Engine installed.

## Install

Docker Assemble requires its own buildkit instance to be running in a Docker container on the local system. You can start and manage the backend using the `backend` subcommand of `docker assemble`.

To start the backend, run:

```
~$ docker assemble backend start
Pulling image «…»: Success
Started backend container "docker-assemble-backend-username" (3e627bb365a4)
```

When the backend is running, it can be used for multiple builds and does not need to be restarted.

> **Note:** For instructions on running a remote backend, accessing logs, saving the build cache in a named volume, accessing a host port, and for information about the buildkit instance, see `--help` .

For advanced backend user information, see [Advanced Backend Management](/assemble/adv-backend-manage/).
