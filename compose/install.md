You can run Compose on macOS, Windows, and 64-bit Linux.

## Prerequisites

Docker Compose relies on Docker Engine for any meaningful work, so make sure you
have Docker Engine installed either locally or remote, depending on your setup.

- On desktop systems like Docker Desktop for Mac and Windows, Docker Compose is
included as part of those desktop installs.

- On Linux systems, first install the
[Docker](/install/index.md#server){: target="_blank" class="_"}
for your OS as described on the Get Docker page, then come back here for
instructions on installing Compose on
Linux systems.

- To run Compose as a non-root user, see [Manage Docker as a non-root user](/install/linux/linux-postinstall.md).

## Install Compose

Follow the instructions below to install Compose on Mac, Windows, Windows Server
2016, or Linux systems, or find out about alternatives like using the `pip`
Python package manager or installing Compose as a container.

> Install a different version
> 
> The instructions below outline installation of the current stable release
> (**v{{site.compose_version}}**) of Compose. To install a different version of
> Compose, replace the given release number with the one that you want. Compose
> releases are also listed and available for direct download on the
> [Compose repository release page on GitHub](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases){:target="_blank" class="_"}.
> To install a **pre-release** of Compose, refer to the [install pre-release builds](#install-pre-release-builds)
> section.

### Install Compose on macOS

**Docker Desktop for Mac** and **Docker Toolbox** already include Compose along
with other Docker apps, so Mac users do not need to install Compose separately.
Docker install instructions for these are here:

  * [Get Docker Desktop for Mac](/docker-for-mac/install.md)
  * [Get Docker Toolbox](/toolbox/overview.md) (for older systems)

</div>
<div id="windows" class="tab-pane fade" markdown="1">

### Install Compose on Windows desktop systems

**Docker Desktop for Windows** and **Docker Toolbox** already include Compose
along with other Docker apps, so most Windows users do not need to
install Compose separately. Docker install instructions for these are here:

* [Get Docker Desktop for Windows](/docker-for-windows/install.md)
* [Get Docker Toolbox](/toolbox/overview.md) (for older systems)

If you are running the Docker daemon and client directly on Microsoft
Windows Server, follow the instructions in the Windows Server tab.

### Install Compose on Windows Server

Follow these instructions if you are running the Docker daemon and client directly
on Microsoft Windows Server with [Docker Engine - Enterprise](/install/windows/docker-ee.md),
and want to install Docker Compose.


1.  Start an "elevated" PowerShell (run it as administrator).
    Search for PowerShell, right-click, and choose
    **Run as administrator**. When asked if you want to allow this app
    to make changes to your device, click **Yes**.
    
2.  In PowerShell, since GitHub now requires TLS1.2, run the following:
    
    ```powershell  
    [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
    ```

    Then run the following command to download the current stable release of
    Compose (v{{site.compose_version}}):

    ```powershell
    Invoke-WebRequest "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/{{site.compose_version}}/docker-compose-Windows-x86_64.exe" -UseBasicParsing -OutFile $Env:ProgramFiles\Docker\docker-compose.exe
    ```

**Note**: On Windows Server 2019, you can add the Compose executable to `$Env:ProgramFiles\Docker`. Because this directory is  registered in the system `PATH`, you can run the `docker-compose --version` command on the subsequent step with no additional configuration.

    > To install a different version of Compose, substitute `{{site.compose_version}}`
    > with the version of Compose you want to use.

3.  Test the installation.

    ```powershell
    docker-compose --version

    docker-compose version {{site.compose_version}}, build 01110ad01
    ```

### Install Compose on Linux systems

On Linux, you can download the Docker Compose binary from the [Compose
repository release page on GitHub](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases){:
target="_blank" class="_"}. Follow the instructions from the link, which involve
running the `curl` command in your terminal to download the binaries. These step-by-step instructions are also included below.

> For `alpine`, the following dependency packages are needed:
> `py-pip`, `python-dev`, `libffi-dev`, `openssl-dev`, `gcc`, `libc-dev`, and `make`.
{: .important}

1.  Run this command to download the current stable release of Docker Compose:

    ```bash
    sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/{{site.compose_version}}/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    ```

    > To install a different version of Compose, substitute `{{site.compose_version}}`
    > with the version of Compose you want to use.

    If you have problems installing with `curl`, see
    [Alternative Install Options](install.md#alternative-install-options) tab above.

2.  Apply executable permissions to the binary:

    ```bash
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    ```
    
> **Note**: If the command `docker-compose` fails after installation, check your path.
> You can also create a symbolic link to `/usr/bin` or any other directory in your path.

For example:

```bash
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/docker-compose /usr/bin/docker-compose
```

3.  Optionally, install [command completion](completion.md) for the
    `bash` and `zsh` shell.

4.  Test the installation.

    ```bash
    $ docker-compose --version
    docker-compose version {{site.compose_version}}, build 1110ad01
    ```

### Alternative install options

- [Install using pip](#install-using-pip)
- [Install as a container](#install-as-a-container)

#### Install using pip

> For `alpine`, the following dependency packages are needed:
> `py-pip`, `python-dev`, `libffi-dev`, `openssl-dev`, `gcc`, `libc-dev`, and `make`.
{: .important}

Compose can be installed from
[pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/docker-compose) using `pip`. If you install
using `pip`, we recommend that you use a
[virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) because many operating
systems have python system packages that conflict with docker-compose
dependencies. See the [virtualenv
tutorial](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) to get
started.

```bash
pip install docker-compose
```
If you are not using virtualenv,

```bash
sudo pip install docker-compose
```

> pip version 6.0 or greater is required.

#### Install as a container

Compose can also be run inside a container, from a small bash script wrapper. To
install compose as a container run this command:

```bash
sudo curl -L --fail https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/{{site.compose_version}}/run.sh -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

## Install pre-release builds

If you're interested in trying out a pre-release build, you can download release
candidates from the [Compose repository release page on GitHub](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases){: target="_blank" class="_"}.
Follow the instructions from the link, which involves running the `curl` command
in your terminal to download the binaries.

Pre-releases built from the "master" branch are also available for download at
[https://dl.bintray.com/docker-compose/master/](https://dl.bintray.com/docker-compose/master/){: target="_blank" class="_"}.

> Pre-release builds allow you to try out new features before they are released,
> but may be less stable.
{: .important}


## Upgrading

If you're upgrading from Compose 1.2 or earlier, remove or
migrate your existing containers after upgrading Compose. This is because, as of
version 1.3, Compose uses Docker labels to keep track of containers, and your
containers need to be recreated to add the labels.

If Compose detects containers that were created without labels, it refuses
to run, so that you don't end up with two sets of them. If you want to keep using
your existing containers (for example, because they have data volumes you want
to preserve), you can use Compose 1.5.x to migrate them with the following
command:

```bash
docker-compose migrate-to-labels
```

Alternatively, if you're not worried about keeping them, you can remove them.
Compose just creates new ones.

```bash
docker container rm -f -v myapp_web_1 myapp_db_1 ...
```

## Uninstallation

To uninstall Docker Compose if you installed using `curl`:

```bash
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

To uninstall Docker Compose if you installed using `pip`:

```bash
pip uninstall docker-compose
```

> Got a "Permission denied" error?
>
> If you get a "Permission denied" error using either of the above
> methods, you probably do not have the proper permissions to remove
> `docker-compose`. To force the removal, prepend `sudo` to either of the above
> commands and run again.
