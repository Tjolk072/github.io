title: Docker for Windows Stable Release notes
---

Here are the main improvements and issues per stable release, starting with the
current release. The documentation is always updated for each release.

For system requirements, see
[What to know before you install](install.md#what-to-know-before-you-install).

Release notes for _stable_ releases are listed below, [_edge_ release
notes](edge-release-notes) are also available. (Following the CE release model,
'beta' releases are called 'edge' releases.)  You can learn about both kinds of
releases, and download stable and edge product installers at [Download Docker
for Windows](install.md#download-docker-for-windows).
