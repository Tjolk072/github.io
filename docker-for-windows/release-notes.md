title: Docker for Windows Stable Release notes
---

Here are the main improvements and issues per stable release, starting with the
current release. The documentation is always updated for each release.

For system requirements, see
[What to know before you install](install.md#what-to-know-before-you-install).

Release notes for _stable_ releases are listed below, [_edge_ release
notes](edge-release-notes) are also available. (Following the CE release model,
'beta' releases are called 'edge' releases.)  You can learn about both kinds of
releases, and download stable and edge product installers at [Download Docker
for Windows](install.md#download-docker-for-windows).

> This problem is fixed as of Beta 23 for subsequent auto-updates.

**New**

* To support trusted registry transparently, all trusted CAs (root or intermediate) on the Windows host are automatically copied to Moby

* `Reset Credentials` also unshares the shared drives

* Logs are now rotated every day

* Support multiple DNS servers

* Added `mfsymlinks` SMB option to support symlinks on bind mounted folder

* Added `nobrl` SMB option to support `sqlite` on bind mounted folders

* Detect outdated versions of Kitematic

**Upgrades**

* Docker 1.12.1
* Docker machine 0.8.1
* Linux kernel 4.4.20
* aufs 20160905

**Bug fixes and minor changes**

**General**

* Uploading a diagnostic now shows a proper status message in the Settings

* Docker stops asking to import from Toolbox after an upgrade

* Docker can now import from Toolbox just after HyperV is activated

* Added more debug information to the diagnostics

* Sending anonymous statistics shouldn't hang anymore when Mixpanel is not available

* Support newlines in release notes

* Improve error message when Docker daemon is not responding

* The configuration database is now stored in-memory

* Preserve the stacktrace of PowerShell errors

* Display service stacktrace in error windows

**Networking**

* Improve name servers discovery
* VpnKit supports search domains
* VpnKit is now compiled with OCaml 4.03 rather than 4.02.3

**File sharing**

* Set `cifs` version to 3.02

* VnpKit: reduce the number of sockets used by UDP NAT, reduce the probability

* `slirp`: reduce the number of sockets used by UDP NAT, reduce the probability that NAT rules time out earlier than expected

* Fixed password handling for host file system sharing

**Hyper-V**

* Automatically disable lingering net adapters that prevent Docker from starting or using the network

* Automatically delete duplicated MobyLinuxVMs on a `reset to factory defaults`

* Improved the HyperV detection and activation mechanism

**Moby**

* Fixed Moby Diagnostics and Update Kernel

* Use default `sysfs` settings, transparent huge pages disabled

* `Cgroup` mount to support `systemd` in containers

**Known issues**

* Docker automatically disables lingering net adapters. The only way to remove them is manually using `devmgmt.msc` as documented in [Remove stale network adapters](troubleshoot.md#4-remove-stale-network-adapters) under [Networking issues](troubleshoot.md#networking-issues) in Troubleshooting.
