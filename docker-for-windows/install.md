##  What to know before you install

* **README FIRST for Docker Toolbox and Docker Machine users**: Docker Desktop for
  Windows requires Microsoft Hyper-V to run. The Docker Desktop for Windows installer
  enables Hyper-V for you, if needed, and restarts your machine. After Hyper-V is
  enabled, VirtualBox no longer works, but any VirtualBox VM images remain.
  VirtualBox VMs created with `docker-machine` (including the `default` one
  typically created during Toolbox install) no longer start. These VMs cannot be
  used side-by-side with Docker Desktop for Windows. However, you can still use
  `docker-machine` to manage remote VMs.

* **System Requirements**:
  - Windows 10 64bit: Pro, Enterprise or Education (Build 15063 or later).
  - Virtualization is enabled in BIOS. Typically, virtualization is enabled by
    default. This is different from having Hyper-V enabled. For more detail see
    [Virtualization must be
    enabled](troubleshoot.md#virtualization-must-be-enabled) in Troubleshooting.
  - CPU SLAT-capable feature.
  - At least 4GB of RAM.

>  **Note**: If your system does not meet the requirements to run Docker Desktop for
> Windows, you can install [Docker Toolbox](/toolbox/overview.md), which uses
> Oracle Virtual Box instead of Hyper-V.

* **What the Docker Desktop for Windows install includes**: The installation provides
  [Docker Engine](/engine/userguide/), Docker CLI client, [Docker
  Compose](/compose/overview.md), [Docker Machine](/machine/overview.md), and
  [Kitematic](/kitematic/userguide.md).
* Containers and images created with Docker Desktop for Windows are shared between all
  user accounts on machines where it is installed. This is because all Windows
  accounts use the same VM to build and run containers.
* Nested virtualization scenarios, such as running Docker Desktop for Windows on a
  VMWare or Parallels instance might work, but there are no guarantees. For
  more information, see [Running Docker Desktop for Windows in nested virtualization
  scenarios](troubleshoot.md#running-docker-desktop-for-windows-in-nested-virtualization-scenarios)

**Note**: Refer to the [Docker compatibility matrix](https://success.docker.com/article/compatibility-matrix) for complete Docker compatibility information with Windows Server.

### About Windows containers

Looking for information on using Windows containers?

* [Switch between Windows and Linux
  containers](/docker-for-windows/index.md#switch-between-windows-and-linux-containers)
  describes the Linux / Windows containers toggle in Docker Desktop for Windows and
  points you to the tutorial mentioned above.
* [Getting Started with Windows Containers
  (Lab)](https://github.com/docker/labs/blob/master/windows/windows-containers/README.md)
  provides a tutorial on how to set up and run Windows containers on Windows 10
  or with Windows Server 2016. It shows you how to use a MusicStore application
  with Windows containers.
* Docker Container Platform for Windows Server 2016 [articles and blog
  posts](https://www.docker.com/microsoft/) on the Docker website

## Install Docker Desktop for Windows desktop app

1. Double-click **Docker Desktop for Windows Installer.exe** to run the installer.

    If you haven't already downloaded the installer (`Docker Desktop
    Installer.exe`), you can get it from
    [**download.docker.com**](https://download.docker.com/win/stable/Docker%20for%20Windows%20Installer.exe).
    It typically downloads to your `Downloads` folder, or you can run it from
    the recent downloads bar at the bottom of your web browser.

2. Follow the install wizard to accept the license, authorize the installer, and
   proceed with the install.

    You are asked to authorize `Docker.app` with your system password during the
    install process. Privileged access is needed to install networking
    components, links to the Docker apps, and manage the Hyper-V VMs.

3. Click **Finish** on the setup complete dialog to launch Docker.

## Start Docker Desktop for Windows

Docker does not start automatically after installation. To start it, search for
Docker, select **Docker Desktop for Windows** in the search results, and click it (or
hit Enter).

When the whale in the status bar stays steady, Docker is up-and-running, and
accessible from any terminal window.

If the whale is hidden in the Notifications area, click the up arrow on the
taskbar to show it. To learn more, see [Docker
Settings](/docker-for-windows/index.md#docker-settings-dialog).

If you just installed the app, you also get a popup success message with
suggested next steps, and a link to this documentation.

When initialization is complete, select **About Docker** from the Notifications
area icon to verify that you have the latest version.

Congratulations! You are up and running with Docker Desktop for Windows.
